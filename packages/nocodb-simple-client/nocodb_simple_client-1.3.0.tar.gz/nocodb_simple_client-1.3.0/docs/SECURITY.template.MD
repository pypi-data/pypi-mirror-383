## 🛡️ Security Measures

### 🏛️ Repository Security

- **🛡️ Branch Protection**: Main branches are protected with required reviews
- **🔐 Two-Factor Authentication**: Required for all maintainers
- **✍️ Signed Commits**: Encouraged for all contributions
- **📦 Dependency Management**: Regular updates and vulnerability scanning via pip-audit and safety
- **🐍 PyPI Security**: Secure publishing with trusted publishing and API tokens

### 🤖 Automated Security Scanning

We employ multiple layers of automated security scanning:

1. **🔍 Bandit**: Python security linter for common security issues
2. **🛡️ Safety**: Checks dependencies for known security vulnerabilities
3. **🔎 pip-audit**: Audits Python packages for known vulnerabilities
4. **🧬 CodeQL**: Static analysis for code vulnerabilities
5. **🎯 Semgrep**: Additional static analysis for Python security patterns

### 📦 Package Security

Our Python package follows security best practices:

- **⚖️ Minimal Dependencies**: Reduced attack surface with minimal required dependencies
- **📌 Version Pinning**: Specific dependency versions to prevent supply chain attacks
- **🔒 Secure API Communication**: HTTPS-only connections to NocoDB instances
- **✅ Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs and API responses

## 📚 Security Best Practices

### 👥 For Contributors

1. **👀 Code Review**: All changes require review by maintainers
2. **🔐 Secrets**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or sensitive data
3. **📦 Dependencies**:
   - Use specific versions rather than ranges when possible
   - Review new dependencies for security issues using `pip-audit` and `safety`
   - Keep dependencies updated and minimal
4. **✅ Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize external inputs from NocoDB API
5. **⚠️ Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information (API keys, database details) in error messages
6. **🐍 Python Security**: Follow secure Python coding practices and use `bandit` for security linting

### 📱 For Library Users

1. **🔄 Keep Updated**: Use the latest supported version from PyPI
2. **🗝️ API Key Security**:
   - Store NocoDB API keys securely (environment variables, key vaults)
   - Never hardcode API keys in your source code
   - Use read-only API keys when possible
3. **🌐 Network Security**:
   - Always use HTTPS connections to NocoDB
   - Validate SSL certificates in production
4. **🧹 Input Sanitization**: Sanitize data before sending to NocoDB
5. **⚠️ Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information
6. **📦 Dependency Management**: Regularly audit your project dependencies

### 🐍 For Python Package Maintainers

1. **🚀 PyPI Publishing**: Use trusted publishing or secure API tokens
2. **🏷️ Version Management**: Follow semantic versioning for security updates
3. **🧪 Testing**: Include security-focused unit tests
4. **📖 Documentation**: Provide clear security guidelines for users
5. **⚡ Vulnerability Response**: Respond promptly to security reports

## 📊 Security Monitoring

We continuously monitor our security posture through:

- **🤖 Automated Scanning**: Daily scans for vulnerabilities using Python security tools
- **📦 PyPI Package Monitoring**: Monitoring for malicious packages with similar names
- **🔔 Dependency Monitoring**: Automated alerts for vulnerable dependencies
- **📝 Access Logging**: Monitoring of repository access and changes
- **🤝 Community Reports**: Encouraging security research and responsible disclosure
- **📡 Security Advisories**: Subscribing to Python and NocoDB security feeds

## 🚨 Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **⚡ Immediate Assessment**: Evaluate severity and scope
2. **🛑 Containment**: Take immediate steps to limit exposure
3. **🔍 Investigation**: Thorough analysis of the incident
4. **📢 Communication**: Transparent communication with affected parties
5. **🔄 Recovery**: Implement fixes and restore normal operations
6. **📝 Post-Incident**: Review and improve security measures
