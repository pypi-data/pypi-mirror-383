# OpenAIChatHelper

Getting annoyed at managing complicated and long prompts and doing substitutions. So creating this helper to make things easier.


## Installation

First, obtain your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

Then, export your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

To avoid repeating this every session, add the line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

Install the package locally:

```bash
pip install ./
```

## Usage

See `example_usage.py`.
