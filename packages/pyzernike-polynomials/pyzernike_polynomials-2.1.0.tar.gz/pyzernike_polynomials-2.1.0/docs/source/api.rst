Generalities and notations about Zernike Polynomials
-------------------------------------------------------

For a polynomial of order :math:`n` and repetition :math:`m`, the Zernike polynomial :math:`Z_{n}^{m}(\rho, \theta)` is defined on the unit disk as:

.. math::

      Z_{n}^{m}(\rho, \theta) = R_{n}^{m}(\rho) \cos(m \theta) \quad \text{if} \quad m \geq 0
   
.. math::

   Z_{n}^{m}(\rho, \theta) = R_{n}^{-m}(\rho) \sin(-m \theta) \quad \text{if} \quad m < 0

Where :math:`R_{n}^{m}(\rho)` is the radial polynomial defined as:

.. math::

   R_{n}^{m}(\rho) = \sum_{k=0}^{(n-m)/2} \frac{(-1)^k (n-k)!}{k! ((n+m)/2 - k)! ((n-m)/2 - k)!} \rho^{n-2k}

The derivative of order (derivative (a)) of the Zernike polynomial with respect to rho and order (derivative (b)) with respect to theta is defined as follows :

.. math::

   \frac{\partial^{a}\partial^{b}Z_{n}^{m}(\rho, \theta)}{\partial \rho^{a} \partial \theta^{b}} = \frac{\partial^{a}R_{n}^{m}(\rho)}{\partial \rho^{a}} \frac{\partial^{b}\cos(m \theta)}{\partial \theta^{b}} \quad \text{if} \quad m > 0

.. note::

   Thus any polynomial evaluated at :math:`(\rho, \theta)` can be defined by 4 parameters :

   - n : order of the polynomial noted ``n`` in the documentation
   - m : degree of the polynomial noted ``m`` in the documentation
   - a : order of the derivative with respect to :math:`\rho` noted ``rho_derivative`` in the arguments.
   - b : order of the derivative with respect to :math:`\theta` noted ``theta_derivative`` in the arguments.
