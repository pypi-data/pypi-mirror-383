# 🎯 TargetGym: Reinforcement Learning Environments for Target MDPs



**TargetGym** is a lightweight yet realistic collection of **reinforcement learning environments** designed around **target MDPs** — tasks where the objective is to **reach and maintain a specific subset of states** (target states).

Environments are built to be **fast, parallelizable, and physics-based**, enabling large-scale RL research while capturing the core challenges of real-world control systems such as **delays, irrecoverable states, partial observability, and competing objectives**.

Currently included environments:

* 🛩 **Plane** – control of a 2D Airbus A320-like aircraft - Stable-Target-MDP
* 🚗 **Car** – maintain a desired speed on a road - Stable-Target-MDP
* 🚲 **Bike** – stabilize and steer a 2D bicycle model - Unstable-Target-MDP (from [Randlov et al.](https://gwern.net/doc/reinforcement-learning/model-free/1998-randlov.pdf))

As well as environments adapted from [Process-Control Gym](https://github.com/MaximilianB2/pc-gym) (with gymnax support for faster speeds):
* 🧪 **CSTR** - control of a chemical reaction in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR).
* **More to come**

| Environment | Target Type         | Action Dim | State Dim | Steps / Second (1 env - $10^8$ steps - CPU) |
|-------------|---------------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 🛩 Plane    | Stable-Target-MDP   | 2 (power, stick) | 9 (z, ż, ẋ, θ, θ̇, …) | ~0.54M |
| 🚗 Car      | Stable-Target-MDP   | 1 (throttle/brake) | 12 (velocity, lidar, …) | ~0.85M |
| 🚲 Bike     | Unstable-Target-MDP | 2 (torque, displacement) | 5 (angle, angular vel, pos, …) | ~1.77M |
| 🧪 CSTR     | Stable-Target-MDP   | 1 (coolant temperature) | 3 (concentration, temperature, target temperature) | ~1.49M |

## Features

* **Fast & parallelizable** with JAX — scale to thousands of parallel environments on GPU/TPU.
* **Physics-based**: Derived from modeling equations, not arcade physics.
* **Reliable**: Unit-tested for stability and reproducibility.
* **Target MDP focus**: Each task is about reaching and maintaining target states.
* **Challenging dynamics**: Captures irrecoverable states, and momentum effects.
* **Visualization**: All environments come with visualization.
* **Compatible with RL libraries**: Offers [Gymnax](https://github.com/RobertTLange/gymnax) and [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) interfaces.
* 📦 **Upcoming features**: Environmental perturbations (wind, turbulence, bumpy road) and fuel consumption.

## Stability

<!-- 
Below is an example of how stable altitude changes with engine power and pitch in the **Plane** environment:

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/plane/3d_altitude.png" width="70%"/>
</p> -->

TargetGym offers a variety of **stable-target-MDPs**. This can be seen in the evolution of the target variable under constant policies for all environments:

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="figures/plane/power_trajectories.png" width="80%"/><br/>
      Plane
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="figures/bike/power_trajectories.png" width="80%"/><br/>
      Bike
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="figures/car/throttle_trajectories.png" width="80%"/><br/>
      Car
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="figures/cstr/trajectories.png" width="80%"/><br/>
      CSTR
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Some environments like Plane and Bike offer 2D-actions, for example power and stick for Plane:

</p> 

<!-- 
This illustrates **multi-stability**: with fixed power and pitch, the aircraft naturally converges to a stable altitude. Similar properties can be found in Car environment -->

## Installation

Once released on PyPI, install with:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install target-gym

# Or with Poetry
poetry add target-gym
```

---

## Usage

Here’s a minimal example of running an episode in the **Plane** environment and saving a video:

```python
from target_gym import Plane, PlaneParams

# Create env
env = Plane()
seed = 42
env_params = PlaneParams(max_steps_in_episode=1_000)

# Simple constant policy with 80% power and 0° stick input
action = (0.8, 0.0)

# Save the video
env.save_video(lambda o: action, seed, folder="videos", episode_index=0, params=env_params, format="gif")
```

Or train an agent using your favorite RL library (example with stable-baselines3):

```python
from target_gym import GymnasiumPlane
from stable_baselines3 import SAC

env = GymnasiumPlane()
model = SAC("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=10_000, log_interval=4)
model.save("sac_plane")

obs, info = env.reset()
while True:
    action, _states = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    if terminated or truncated:
        break
```

## Challenges Modeled

TargetGym tasks are designed to expose RL agents to **realistic control challenges**:

* [x] **Delays**: Inputs (like engine power) take time to fully apply.
* [x] **Partial observability**: Some parts of the state cannot be directly measured.
* [x] **Competing objectives**: Reach the target state quickly while minimizing overshoot or cost.
* [x] **Momentum effects**: Physical inertia delays control effectiveness.
* [x] **Irrecoverable states**: Certain trajectories inevitably lead to failure.
* [ ] **Non-stationarity**: Introduce perturbations in the environments.

---

## Roadmap

* [ ] Add perturbations (wind, turbulence, uneven terrain) for non-stationary dynamics.
* [ ] Easier interface for creating partially-observable variants.
* [ ] Provide benchmark results for popular RL baselines.
* [ ] Add fuel consumption and resource constraints.
* [ ] Add more PC-gym tasks.
