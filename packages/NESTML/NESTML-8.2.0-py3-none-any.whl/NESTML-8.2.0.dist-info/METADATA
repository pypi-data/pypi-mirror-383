Name: NESTML
Version: 8.2.0
Summary: NESTML is a domain specific language that supports the specification of neuron models in a precise and concise syntax, based on the syntax of Python. Model equations can either be given as a simple string of mathematical notation or as an algorithm written in the built-in procedural language. The equations are analyzed by NESTML to compute an exact solution if possible or use an  appropriate numeric solver otherwise.
