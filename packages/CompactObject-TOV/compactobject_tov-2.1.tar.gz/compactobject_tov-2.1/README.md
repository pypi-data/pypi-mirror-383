# CompactObject
![Logo](logo.png)
**CompactObject** is an open-source package designed to perform Bayesian inference on neutron star equation of state (EOS) constraints. It offers a comprehensive workflow that integrates astrophysical observations and nuclear measurements to explore the interior composition of neutron stars. The package is built to be user-friendly, easily extendable, and thoroughly documented, making it an essential tool for researchers in nuclear astrophysics.

We have a detailed documentation please check here: [CompactObject Package Website](https://chunhuangphy.github.io/CompactObject/)

## Core Functionality

CompactObject offers a range of functionalities essential for constraining the EOS of neutron stars:

1. **Equation of State (EOS) Generation**
    - Utilizes multiple physics/meta models, including Relativistic Mean Field (RMF), strange star, quark star, polytrope, and speed of sound models, to generate neutron star EOS.
    - [EOSgenerators](https://github.com/ChunHuangPhy/EoS_inference/blob/main/EOSgenerators) Package

2. **Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) Solver**
    - Solves the TOV equations for a spherically symmetric compact object based on a given neutron star EOS.
    - [TOVsolver](https://github.com/ChunHuangPhy/EoS_inference/blob/main/TOVsolver) Package

3. **Bayesian Inference Workflow**
    - Implements neutron star EOS inference using Nested Sampling.
    - Provide options for single machine users using MCMC sampling by emcee.
    - Integrates constraints from nuclear experiments, neutron star mass and/or radius observations (from X-ray timing and/or radio timing), and tidal measurements from gravitational wave detections.
