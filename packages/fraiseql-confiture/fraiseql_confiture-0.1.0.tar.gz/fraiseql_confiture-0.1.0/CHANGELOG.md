## Version History Summary

| Version | Date | Key Features |
|---------|------|--------------|
| 0.2.0-alpha | 2025-10-11 | Rust performance layer, 10-50x speedup |
| 0.1.0-alpha | 2025-10-11 | Core schema builder, CLI, migrations |

## Migration Guide

### From 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

No breaking changes! Upgrade is seamless:

```bash
pip install --upgrade confiture
```

**What's New:**
- Rust extension auto-detected and used for performance
- Falls back to Python if Rust unavailable
- All existing code continues to work unchanged

**To verify Rust extension:**
```python
from confiture.core.builder import HAS_RUST
print(f"Rust available: {HAS_RUST}")
```

**Performance improvements:**
- `SchemaBuilder.build()`: 5-10x faster
- `SchemaBuilder.compute_hash()`: 30-60x faster
