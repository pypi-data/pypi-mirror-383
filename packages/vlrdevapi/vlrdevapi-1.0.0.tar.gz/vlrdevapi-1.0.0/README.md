```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanshbordia/vlrdevapi.git
cd vlrdevapi
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Quick Start

```python
import vlrdevapi as vlr

# List VCT events
events = vlr.events.list_events(tier="vct", status="ongoing")
for event in events:
    print(f"{event.name} - {event.status}")

# Player profile and stats
profile = vlr.players.profile(player_id=4164)
print(f"{profile.handle} ({profile.real_name}) - {profile.country}")

agent_stats = vlr.players.agent_stats(player_id=4164, timespan="60d")
for stat in agent_stats:
    print(f"{stat.agent}: {stat.rating} rating, {stat.acs} ACS")

# Series information
info = vlr.series.info(match_id=530935)
print(f"{info.teams[0].name} vs {info.teams[1].name}")
print(f"Score: {info.score[0]}-{info.score[1]}")
```

## Complete API Reference

### Events Module - Tournament and Competition Data

```python
import vlrdevapi as vlr

# List events with filters
events = vlr.events.list_events(
    tier="vct",           # "all", "vct", "vcl", "t3", "gc", "cg", "offseason"
    region="na",          # Optional region filter
    status="ongoing",     # "all", "upcoming", "ongoing", "completed"
    page=1
)

# Get event details
info = vlr.events.info(event_id=2498)

# Get event matches
matches = vlr.events.matches(event_id=2498)

# Get event standings
standings = vlr.events.standings(event_id=2498)
```

### Matches Module - Match Schedules and Results

```python
import vlrdevapi as vlr

# Upcoming matches
upcoming = vlr.matches.upcoming(limit=10)

# Live matches
live = vlr.matches.live()

# Completed matches
completed = vlr.matches.completed(limit=10, page=1)
```

### Players Module - Player Information and Statistics

```python
import vlrdevapi as vlr

# Player profile
profile = vlr.players.profile(player_id=4164)

# Player match history
matches = vlr.players.matches(player_id=4164, limit=20)

# Agent statistics
stats = vlr.players.agent_stats(
    player_id=4164,
    timespan="60d"  # "30d", "60d", "90d", "all"
)
```

### Series Module - Detailed Match Analytics

```python
import vlrdevapi as vlr

# Series/match information
info = vlr.series.info(match_id=530935)

# Detailed map statistics
maps = vlr.series.matches(series_id=530935)
for map_data in maps:
    print(f"Map: {map_data.map_name}")
    for player in map_data.players:
        print(f"  {player.name}: {player.k}/{player.d}/{player.a}")
```

## Data Models and Type Safety

All API responses are returned as immutable Pydantic models with complete type hints:

| Model | Purpose | Key Fields |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `ListEvent` | Event list entries | id, name, status, dates, prize |
| `Info` | Detailed event data | name, prize, location, regions |
| `Match` | Match information | teams, score, event, status |
| `Profile` | Player profiles | handle, real_name, country, teams |
| `AgentStats` | Agent performance | agent, rating, acs, kd, kast |
| `MapPlayers` | Map statistics | map_name, players, teams, rounds |

### Model Features

- **Immutable**: All models are frozen after creation
- **Validated**: Automatic data validation using Pydantic
- **Serializable**: Easy conversion to dict/JSON
- **Type-Hinted**: Full IDE autocomplete support

```python
# Access model fields
profile = vlr.players.profile(player_id=4164)
print(profile.handle)  # IDE autocomplete works

# Convert to dictionary
data = profile.model_dump()

# Serialize to JSON
json_str = profile.model_dump_json()
```

## Use Cases

vlrdevapi is perfect for:

- **Data Analysis**: Build analytics dashboards and statistics trackers
- **Betting Tools**: Create prediction models and odds calculators  
- **Tournament Tracking**: Monitor ongoing events and match results
- **Player Scouting**: Analyze player performance across agents and maps
- **Content Creation**: Generate automated match reports and summaries
- **Discord Bots**: Real-time match notifications and statistics
- **Research**: Academic studies on esports performance and trends

## Advanced Usage

### Pagination

Many functions support pagination for large datasets:

```python
import vlrdevapi as vlr

# Get specific page
events = vlr.events.list_events(tier="vct", page=2)

# Limit results
matches = vlr.matches.upcoming(limit=20)

# Combine pagination with limits
results = vlr.matches.completed(limit=50, page=1)
```

### Filtering

Filter data by multiple criteria:

```python
# Filter events by tier and status
vct_events = vlr.events.list_events(
    tier="vct",
    region="na",
    status="ongoing"
)

# Filter player stats by timespan
recent_stats = vlr.players.agent_stats(
    player_id=4164,
    timespan="30d"  # Options: "30d", "60d", "90d", "all"
)
```

### Cache Management

```python
import vlrdevapi as vlr

# Clear cache for fresh data
vlr.fetcher.clear_cache()

# Close connections on shutdown
vlr.fetcher.close_connections()
```

## Error Handling

The library raises specific exceptions for different error cases:

```python
from vlrdevapi.exceptions import NetworkError, RateLimitError

try:
    events = vlr.events.list_events()
except RateLimitError:
    print("Rate limited by VLR.gg")
except NetworkError as e:
    print(f"Network error: {e}")
```

## Testing

The library includes comprehensive tests with real HTML fixtures:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/lib/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/lib/ --cov=vlrdevapi

# Run specific test module
pytest tests/lib/test_events.py -v
```
