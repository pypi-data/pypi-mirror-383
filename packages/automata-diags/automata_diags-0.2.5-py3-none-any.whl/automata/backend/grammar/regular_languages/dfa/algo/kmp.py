Implements the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) pattern-matching algorithm in two ways:

1. build_kmp_dfa(pattern, alphabet):
   - Returns a deterministic finite automaton (transitions, start_state, accept_states)
     that accepts precisely those strings whose last m characters match 'pattern'.

2. kmp_search(pattern, text):
   - Returns a list of all 0-based start indices where 'pattern' is found in 'text'.

    Build a DFA from a 'pattern' using the KMP approach.
