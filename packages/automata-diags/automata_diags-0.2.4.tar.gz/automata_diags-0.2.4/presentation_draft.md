## Slide 2: Introduction: What is Automata Diags?

**The Problem:**
*   Learning automata theory can be abstract and challenging.
*   Existing tools can be complex, outdated, or lack visualization features.
*   There's a gap between theoretical concepts in textbooks and practical, runnable code.

**The Solution: Automata Diags**
*   A Python library designed to make automata theory accessible and intuitive.
*   Provides a complete toolset for students, educators, and researchers.
*   Focuses on clear, "textbook-like" API design and instant visualization.

---

## Slide 3: Project Vision & Philosophy

*   **Ultimate Goal:** To build a comprehensive, educational toolkit covering the full spectrum of a standard Theory of Computation course.
*   **Educational Focus:** An API designed to map closely to theoretical concepts, making it an excellent companion for learning.
*   **Modern & Robust:** Built with modern Python and research-grade algorithms, providing a reliable foundation for future expansion.
*   **Visual & Interactive:** A core belief that seeing and simulating machines is key to understanding them.

---

## Slide 4: Project Roadmap: Implemented & Future Features

**Currently Implemented:** A solid foundation in Regular and Context-Free Languages.
*   **Finite Automata:** DFAs, NFAs, and NFA-to-DFA conversion.
*   **Regular Expressions:** Conversion to NFAs.
*   **Context-Free Grammars:** Parsing and conversion to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).
*   **Advanced Algorithms:** Hopcroft's DFA minimization.
*   **Core Infrastructure:** Visualization engine and an interactive web-based simulator.

**The Final Product Vision (Capstone Scope):**
*   **Pushdown Automata (PDAs):** Full implementation and simulation for context-free languages.
*   **Turing Machines:** A versatile implementation for exploring the limits of computation.
*   **Decidability & Recognizability:** Modules and examples to demonstrate key computability concepts.
*   **An Expanded Web Simulator:** An interface capable of visualizing and simulating all machine types (DFAs, PDAs, Turing Machines).

## Slide 5: Technical Deep Dive: A Scalable Architecture

A decoupled frontend and backend designed for future growth.

*   **Backend (Python):**
    *   Manages all the core logic for automata theory.
    *   **Modular Design:** The class structure is designed to be extensible, allowing for the clean addition of new machine types like PDAs and Turing Machines.
    *   Provides a robust API for programmatic use.
    *   Includes a `drawings` module for visualization.
*   **Frontend (React):**
    *   A user-friendly web interface for simulating and visualizing the machines implemented in the backend.
    *   Communicates with the backend via a REST API (or can be used standalone).
    *   Provides components for drawing graphs and simulating machine execution.

## Slide 6: Case Study 1: Algorithmic Robustness

**Challenge:** Implementing the Context-Free Grammar (CFG) to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) conversion.

*   **Initial Problem:** An early implementation failed on certain grammars due to an incorrect ordering of transformation steps.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Research:** Dived deep into academic sources to understand the subtle dependencies between steps (e.g., eliminating null vs. unit productions).
    2.  **Iteration:** Tested multiple algorithmic sequences against complex, recursive grammars.
    3.  **Decision:** Adopted the robust, academically-standard sequence (**START → TERM → BIN → DEL → UNIT**) to ensure correctness for a wider variety of grammars.
*   **Outcome:** A reliable and correct `to_cnf()` method that showcases the project's commitment to quality.

---

## Slide 7: Case Study 2: User-Focused API Design

**Challenge:** Making the library easy and intuitive to use, especially for quick examples and teaching.

*   **Initial Problem:** Creating a simple DFA required a verbose, multi-line constructor, which was cumbersome for documentation and tutorials.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** Realized the problem wasn't just fixing the docs, but improving the user experience.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Implemented the `DFA.from_string()` class method, allowing users to define a DFA in a single, intuitive line.
    *   Proactively added `NFA.from_string()` for API consistency.
*   **Outcome:** A more ergonomic and predictable API that lowers the barrier to entry for new users.

---

## Slide 8: The Web Interface: A Simulation Sandbox

An interactive front-end to bring automata to life.

*   **The Goal:** Provide a "hands-on" learning experience that complements the Python library, allowing users to build and test machines visually.
*   **Technology:** Built with React.
*   **Current Features:**
    *   Visualize DFAs as interactive graphs.
    *   Simulate string acceptance step-by-step.
*   **Future Expansion:** The UI will be extended to support the simulation of Pushdown Automata and Turing Machines, providing a unified environment for the entire computability hierarchy.

## Slide 9: Code Example: A Simple DFA

Let's see how easy it is to create, test, and visualize a DFA that accepts strings ending in "ab".

```python
from automata.backend.grammar.dist import Symbol
from automata.backend.grammar.regular_languages.dfa.dfa_mod import DFA
from automata.backend.drawings.automata_drawer import AutomataDrawer

# 1. Create a DFA from a simple string definition
# Format: "state,input,next_state"
dfa = DFA.from_string(
    "q0,a,q1;q1,b,q2;q0,b,q0;q1,a,q1;q2,a,q1;q2,b,q0",
    start_state="q0",
    accept_states={"q2"}
)

# 2. Test if it accepts a valid string
is_accepted = dfa.accepts([Symbol('a'), Symbol('a'), Symbol('b')])
print(f"Accepts 'aab'? {is_accepted}") # True

# 3. Visualize it
drawer = AutomataDrawer()
drawer.draw_dfa_from_object(dfa, "simple_dfa_example")
```
