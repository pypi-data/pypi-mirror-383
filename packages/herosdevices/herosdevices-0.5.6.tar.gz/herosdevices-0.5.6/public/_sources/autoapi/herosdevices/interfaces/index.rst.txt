.. py:class:: Interface

   Generic Interface to describe and check capabilities of a device driver.


.. py:class:: UnionInterfaceMeta

   Bases: :py:obj:`type`


   This metaclass is used to correctly unify the implementation attributes during multiple inheritance.

   The _heros_implements and _hero_methods attributes are combined from all base classes.

   .. caution::
       This is not meant to be inherited from directly but used with the `metaclass` keyword.
