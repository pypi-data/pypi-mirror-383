## Install shell completion (zsh)

A completion script for zsh is provided in the directory `completion/zsh/_wallabag`.

Installation can vary based on your zsh settings and environment. Most importantly, the file has to be placed in one of the directories contained in the `$fpath` variable and then autoloaded.

If you want to install the completion script for all users, you can do the following:

```sh
mkdir -p /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
cp _wallabag /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
```

and restart zsh.

A better option is to have a directory in your home for local completion scripts, but setting this up is beyond the scope of these instructions. You may refer to [this answer on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67161186) for more details.
