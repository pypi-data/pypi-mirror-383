title: Infrahub MCP Server
---

Infrahub MCP Server lets AI assistants and IDE agents talk to your Infrahub “source-of-truth” safely and in a standardized way.
It implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so any MCP-compatible client (agent mode in IDEs, chat assistants, automation runners, etc.) can discover tools, request context, and perform actions against your Infrahub instance—without custom glue code.
