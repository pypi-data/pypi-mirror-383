            max_cycles: Maximum cycle count to run to. Default 1.1x the expected cycle count in the solution metadata,

                         Pass 0 to disable hashing.
            strict: Require that expected_score isn't None, always validating it.

                definition of a precognitive solution. Default False.

                check times out, in which case the TimeoutError is returned in the 'error' field.
                See `Solution.is_precognitive` for more info and a direct API.
