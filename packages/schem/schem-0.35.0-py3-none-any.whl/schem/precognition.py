    """Run this solution enough times to check if fits the community definition of a precognitive solution.

    If time constraints do not allow enough runs for even 90% certainty either way, raise a TimeoutError.

    Currently, a solution is considered precognitive if:
    * It assumes the value of the Nth molecule of a random input, for some N >= 2.
      Stated conversely, a solution (with acceptable success rate) is non-precognitive if, for each random input I,
      each N >= 2, and each type of molecule M that I produces, there exists a random seed where the Nth input of I is
      M, and the solution succeeds.
    * OR it succeeds for < 20% of random seeds.
      Accordingly with the first rule excepting the first input molecule, this check only uses seeds that match
      the first molecule (or all first molecules if there are multiple random inputs), if that is more favourable.

    In practice we check this with the following process:
    1. Run the solution on the original level, verifying it succeeds (validate the solution's expected score here too if
       possible). Track how many molecules were generated from each random input (call this M), and what the mth
       molecule's variant was for every m up to M.
    2. Randomize the input seed (in the case of two random inputs, shift the second seed by the same amount).
    3. Repeat step 1 with the new random seed(s) (but without requiring that the run succeed). Update M for each random
       input to be the minimum number of molecules produced from that input for any passing run (since any unconsumed
       input cannot have been assumed). Once again track the molecule variants that appeared, keeping a tally of how
       many times each variant has been in a passing vs failing run.
    4. Repeat steps 2-3 until any of the following conditions is met (again ignoring seeds that had a differing first
       molecule if that is more forgiving):
       * The success rate is measured to be < 20%, with 99.9% confidence (precog).
       * The success rate is measured to be > 20% with 99.9% confidence, and the dataset of succeeding runs covers
         every possible variant of every possible mth molecule (2 <= m <= M), for all random inputs (non-precog).
       * A variant of the mth molecule fails sufficiently many runs without ever succeeding (precog).
         This threshold is calculated dynamically based on the observed success rate.
       * The maximum allowed runs based on max_total_cycles is reached (TimeoutError).
         With default settings this should only occur for very long (100k+ cycles) solutions or solutions with a
         failure rate extremely close to 20%.

    Args:
        solution: The loaded solution to check.
        max_cycles: The maximum cycle count allowed for a SINGLE run of the solution (passed to Solution.run).
            Same default as Solution.run for the base seed, and capped to 2x the base seed's cycle count for all
            alternate-seed runs.
        max_total_cycles: The maximum total cycle count that may be used by all runs; if this value is exceeded before
            sufficient confidence in an answer is obtained, a TimeoutError is raised.
        hash_states: Maximum number of unique cycle states to hash within each run for the purposes of loop detection.
            Default 1000. Pass 0 to disable hashing.
        just_run_cycle_count: In order to save on excess runs, if the solution has just been successfully run on the
            loaded level (and not been modified or reset() since), pass its cycle count here to skip the first run (but
            still pull the first run's data from the Solution object).

            (result, explanation, success_rate), where explanation is a string describing why the solution was or was
            not determined to be precognitive, and success_rate is None if the check failed due to a single molecule
            being assumed (since in this case the success rate might not be sufficiently measured), else a number from
            0 to 1 representing the percent of random input sequences that the solution succeeds on, using the allowed
