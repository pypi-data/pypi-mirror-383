        Uploads a file to Telegram's servers, without sending it.

        .. note::

            Generally, you want to use `send_file` instead.

        This method returns a handle (an instance of :tl:`InputFile` or
        :tl:`InputFileBig`, as required) which can be later used before
        it expires (they are usable during less than a day).

        Uploading a file will simply return a "handle" to the file stored
        remotely in the Telegram servers, which can be later used on. This
        will **not** upload the file to your own chat or any chat at all.

        Arguments
            file (`str` | `bytes` | `file`):
                The path of the file, byte array, or stream that will be sent.
                Note that if a byte array or a stream is given, a filename
                or its type won't be inferred, and it will be sent as an
                "unnamed application/octet-stream".

            part_size_kb (`int`, optional):
                Chunk size when uploading files. The larger, the less
                requests will be made (up to 512KB maximum).

            file_size (`int`, optional):
                The size of the file to be uploaded, which will be determined
                automatically if not specified.

                If the file size can't be determined beforehand, the entire
                file will be read in-memory to find out how large it is.

            file_name (`str`, optional):
                The file name which will be used on the resulting InputFile.
                If not specified, the name will be taken from the ``file``
                and if this is not a `str`, it will be ``"unnamed"``.

            use_cache (`type`, optional):
                This parameter currently does nothing, but is kept for
                backward-compatibility (and it may get its use back in
                the future).

            key ('bytes', optional):
                In case of an encrypted upload (secret chats) a key is supplied

            iv ('bytes', optional):
                In case of an encrypted upload (secret chats) an iv is supplied

            progress_callback (`callable`, optional):
                A callback function accepting two parameters:
                ``(sent bytes, total)``.

                When sending an album, the callback will receive a number
                between 0 and the amount of files as the "sent" parameter,
                and the amount of files as the "total". Note that the first
                parameter will be a floating point number to indicate progress
                within a file (e.g. ``2.5`` means it has sent 50% of the third
                file, because it's between 2 and 3).

        Returns
            :tl:`InputFileBig` if the file size is larger than 10MB,
            `InputSizedFile <telethon.tl.custom.inputsizedfile.InputSizedFile>`
            (subclass of :tl:`InputFile`) otherwise.

        Example
            .. code-block:: python

                # Photos as photo and document
                file = await client.upload_file('photo.jpg')
