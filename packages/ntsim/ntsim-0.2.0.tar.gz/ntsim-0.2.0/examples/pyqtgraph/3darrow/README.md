# 3D Arrow Visualization using PyQtGraph

This example demonstrates how to visualize a 3D arrow using the `pyqtgraph` library, not available otherwise in the `pyqtgraph` library.
The arrow is drawn from a specified start point to an end point in a 3D space.

## Overview

The script provides:

- A simple way to visualize a 3D arrow using the `pyqtgraph` library.
- The ability to customize the start and end points of the arrow, as well as its color.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pyqtgraph`
- `PyQt5`

## Usage

To run the example:

```bash
python3 3darrow.py
```

### Details:

The script initializes a 3D view using `GLViewWidget` from the `pyqtgraph` library. It then defines a start point, an end point, and a color for the arrow. The `draw_arrow` function is used to visualize the arrow in the 3D view.

## Output

The script will display a 3D view with the arrow drawn from the specified start point to the end point in the chosen color.
