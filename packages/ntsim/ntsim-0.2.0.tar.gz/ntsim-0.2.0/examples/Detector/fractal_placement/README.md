2. **Scalability**: Easily expandable without changing the fundamental design.
3. **Uniform Coverage**: Improved detection capabilities for neutrinos from various directions.
4. **High Sensitivity at Multiple Scales**: Effective for both high-energy and low-energy neutrinos.
5. **Ease of Modular Construction**: Simplifies the construction and deployment processes.
6. **Optimized Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: Potential for optimized detection capabilities.
7. **Adaptive Sensing**: Allows for different sensing tasks at different "levels" of the fractal.
8. **Natural Resilience**: Offers some level of fault tolerance.

## Caveats

1. **Complexity**: Implementation could be challenging due to the underwater environment.
2. **Calibration and Data Analysis**: Requires new methods for effective data interpretation.
3. **Optical Properties**: Needs evaluation for compatibility with the optical properties of water.
4. **Engineering Challenges**: Must withstand underwater currents, pressure, and other environmental factors.
