    "description": "The possible values are:\n\n``addendum``\n    for a document extending the main publication.\n\n``additional material``\n    for additional material attached to the main publication, that is\n    neither the more specific ``data`` or ``software``.\n\n``data``\n    for a dataset related to the main publication (for Literature) or to\n    the dataset itself (for Data). If the data is versioned, this refers to\n    the aggregate, unversioned dataset.\n\n``erratum``\n    for a document correcting errors in the content of the main\n    publication. When the errors are not in the content but in the\n    publication process, it is considered as an ``editorial note`` instead.\n\n``editorial note``\n    for a document correcting errors in the metadata of the publication but\n    not its content. Otherwise, it is an ``erratum``.\n\n``preprint``\n    for a document that is made public (typically on `arXiv\n    <http://arxiv.org>`_) but not yet published formally.\n\n``publication``\n    for the main publication. If it's not published, it's a ``preprint``.\n\n``part``\n    for a part of the main record. This is used for subsets of datasets,\n    e.g. a single table.\n\n``reprint``\n    for a reprint of the main publication.\n\n``software``\n    for software related to the main publication.\n\n``translation``\n    for a translation of the main publication.\n\n``version``\n    for a version of the main record. This is used for example for versions of datasets.",
