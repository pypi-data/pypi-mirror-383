203YYY,Change reference values,Subsequent element descriptors define new reference values for corresponding Table B entries. Each new reference value is represented by YYY bits in the Data section. Definition of new reference values is concluded by coding this operator with YYY = 255. Negative reference values shall be represented by a positive integer with the left-most bit (bit 1) set to 1.,(see Note 1),1,Operational
204YYY,Add associated field,Precede each data element with YYY bits of information.  This operation associates a data field (e.g. quality control information) of YYY bits with each data element.,"(see Notes 1, 5, 6, 7, 9)","1,5,6,7,9",Operational
205YYY,Signify character,YYY characters (CCITT International Alphabet No. 5) are inserted as a data field of YYY x 8 bits in length.,(see Note 11),11,Operational
206YYY,Signify data width for the immediately following local descriptor,YYY bits of data are described by the immediately following descriptor.,(see Note 12),12,Operational
207YYY,"Increase scale, reference value and data width","For Table B elements, which are not CCITT IA5 (character data), code tables, or flag tables:   1. Add YYY to the existing scale factor   2. Multiply the existing reference value by 10**YYY   3. Calculate ((10 x YYY) + 2) รท 3, disregard any fractional remainder and add the result to the existing bit width.",(see Notes 1 and 4),"1,4",Operational
208YYY,Change width of CCITT IA5 field,YYY characters from CCITT International Alphabet No. 5 (representing YYY x 8 bits in length) replace the specified data width given for each CCITT IA5 element in Table B.,(see Note 1),1,Operational
221YYY,Data not present,"Data values present in Section 4 (Data section) corresponding to the following YYY descriptors shall be limited to data from Classes 01-09, and Class 31.",(see Note 15),15,Operational
222000,Quality information follows,The values of Class 33 elements which follow relate to the data defined by the data present bit-map.,,,Operational
223000,Substituted values operator,The substituted values which follow relate to the data defined by the data present bit-map.,(see Note 14),14,Operational
223255,Substituted values marker operator,This operator shall signify a data item containing a substituted value; the element descriptor for the substituted value is obtained by the application of the data present bit-map associated with the substituted values operator.,(see Note 14),14,Operational
224000,First-order statistical values follow,The statistical values which follow relate to the data defined by the data present bit-map.,(see Note 16),16,Operational
224255,First-order statistical values marker operator,This operator shall signify a data item containing a first-order statistical value of the type indicated by the preceding 0 08 023 element descriptor; the element descriptor to which the first-order statistic relates is obtained by the application of the data present bit-map associated with the first-order statistical values follow operator; first-order statistical values shall be represented as defined by this element descriptor.,(see Note 17),17,Operational
225000,Difference statistical values follow,The statistical values which follow relate to the data defined by the data present bit-map.,,,Operational
225255,Difference statistical values marker operator,"This operator shall signify a data item containing a difference statistical value of the type indicated by the preceding 0 08 024 element descriptor; the element descriptor to which the difference statistical value relates is obtained by the application of the data present bit-map associated with the difference statistical values follow operator; difference statistical values shall be represented as defined by this element descriptor, but with a reference value of -2**n and a data width of (n+1), where n is the data width given by the original descriptor. This special reference value allows the statistical difference values to be centred around zero.",,,Operational
232000,Replaced/retained values follow,The replaced/retained values which follow relate to the data defined by the data present bit-map.,(see Note 13),13,Operational
232255,Replaced/retained value marker operator,This operator shall signify a data item containing the original of an element which has been replaced by a substituted value.  The element descriptor for the retained value is obtained by the application of the data present bit-map associated with the substituted values operator.,(see Note 13),13,Operational
235000,Cancel backward data reference,This operator terminates all previously defined back-ward reference and cancels any previously defined data present bit-map; it causes the next data present bit-map to refer to the data descriptors which immediately precede the operator to which it relates.,,,Operational
236000,Define data present bit-map,This operator defines the data present bit-map which follows for possible re-use; only one data present bit-map may be defined between this operator and the cancel use defined data present bit-map operator.,,,Operational
237000,Use defined data present bit-map,This operator causes the defined data present bit-map to be used again.,,,Operational
237255,Cancel use defined data present bit-map,This operator cancels the re-use of the defined data present bit-map.,,,Operational
241000,Define event,This operator denotes the beginning of the definition of an event.,(see Note 19),19,Operational
241255,Cancel define event,This operator denotes the conclusion of the event definition that was begun via the previous 2 41 000 operator.,,,Operational
242000,Define conditioning event,This operator denotes the beginning of the definition of a conditioning event.,(see Note 19),19,Operational
