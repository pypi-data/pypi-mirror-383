Git Auto Export Plugin
######################

Installation
============

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the `plugin installation guide <../../docs#installation-guide>`_.

Installation required in:

* Studio (CMS)

Configuration
=============

- Enable the following FEATURES flags in the config file in Open edX. For any release after Juniper, that config file is ``/edx/etc/cms.yml``. If you're using ``private.py``, you will need to enable these FEATURES in ``cms/envs/private.py``.

  .. code-block::

    "FEATURES": {
        "ENABLE_EXPORT_GIT": true,
    }

- Set your commit user in ``cms/envs/common.py``, if you don't want to use the default one

  .. code-block::

    GIT_EXPORT_DEFAULT_IDENT = {
        'name': 'STUDIO_EXPORT_TO_GIT',
        'email': 'STUDIO_EXPORT_TO_GIT@example.com'
    }

- Restart the server using ``make studio-restart`` on Devstack or ``tutor dev/local restart openedx`` on Tutor.
- For Tutor installations, these values can also be managed through a `custom tutor plugin <https://docs.tutor.edly.io/tutorials/plugin.html#plugin-development-tutorial>`_.
