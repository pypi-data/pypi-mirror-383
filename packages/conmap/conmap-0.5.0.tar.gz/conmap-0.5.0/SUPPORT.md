# Support Policy

We aim to keep Conmap reliable for security and compliance teams. For questions or issues:

- **Bug reports & feature requests** – Open a GitHub issue with reproduction steps and expected
  behaviour. Issues are triaged within 3 business days.
- **Security vulnerabilities** – Follow the guidance in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Do not disclose
  sensitive findings in public issues.
- **General enquiries** – Email `support@armoriq.io` and include relevant logs or command output.

The project is maintained on a best-effort basis; production-critical users are encouraged to fork
and pin releases. When filing defects, please include the Conmap version (`conmap --version`), the
operating system, and the invocation that triggered the problem.
