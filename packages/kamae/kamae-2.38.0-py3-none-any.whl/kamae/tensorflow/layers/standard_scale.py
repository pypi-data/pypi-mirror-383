    This layer will shift and scale inputs into a distribution centered around
    0 with standard deviation 1. It accomplishes this by precomputing the mean
    and variance of the data, and calling `(input - mean) / sqrt(var)` at
    runtime. mask_value is used to ignore certain values in the standard scaling
    process. They will remain the same value in the output value as they were in

        cannot be broadcast, an error will be raised when this layer's

        example, if shape is `(None, 5)` and `axis=1`, the layer will track 5
        separate mean and variance values for the last axis. If `axis` is set
        to `None`, the layer will normalize all elements in the input by a
        scalar mean and variance. Defaults to -1, where the last axis of the
        input is assumed to be a feature dimension and is normalized per
        index. Note that in the specific case of batched scalar inputs where
        the only axis is the batch axis, the default will normalize each index
