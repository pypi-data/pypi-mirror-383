class Exists:
    """
    A class to encapsulate the functionality of checking if a remote path exists
    using SFTP exists method in Unix-like operating systems.

    Attributes:
        path (str): The remote path to check for existence.

    **Examples:**

    .. code:: python

        yield Exists(path="/path/to/check")

    Usage:
        This class is designed to be used in a generator-based workflow where
        commands are yielded for execution. The existence check result for each
        host will be returned in the operation result.

    Notes:
        The operation will execute on all hosts in the current execution context.
        The path must be a valid remote path accessible via SFTP.
