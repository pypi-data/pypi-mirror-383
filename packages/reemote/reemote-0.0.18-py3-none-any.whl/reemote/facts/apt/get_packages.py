    This helper function processes the raw string output from the
    `apt list --installed` command. It iterates through each line,
    skipping the "Listing..." header and any empty lines. For each valid
    package line, it accurately extracts the package name and its
    corresponding version number.

    Args:
        output (str): The raw string output from the `apt list --installed`
            command.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary
            represents an installed package and contains 'name' and 'version'
            keys. Example: `[{'name': 'zlib1g', 'version': '1:1.2.11.dfsg-2'}]`.

    """A reemote fact that gathers installed APT packages from a Debian-based system.

    When executed by the reemote framework, this operation runs the
    `apt list --installed` command on the target server. It then parses the
    command's output to create a structured list of all installed packages,
    including their names and versions.

    The final result is a list of dictionaries, which is attached to the
    `stdout` attribute of the completed process object. This operation is
    read-only and will always have `changed=False`.
