class Mget_files:
    """
    A class to encapsulate the functionality of multiple builtin downloads using SFTP.
    It allows users to download multiple remote builtin to local host with full parameter support.

    Attributes:
        remotepaths (str): The remote builtin or directory path(s) to download.
        localpath (str): The local path where builtin will be downloaded.
        preserve (bool): Preserve builtin attributes (permissions, timestamps).
        recurse (bool): Recursively download directories.
        follow_symlinks (bool): Follow symbolic links during download.
        sparse (bool): Create sparse builtin on the local system.
        block_size (int): Block size for builtin transfers.
        max_requests (int): Maximum number of concurrent transfer requests.
        progress_handler (Callable): Callback for transfer progress.
        error_handler (Callable): Callback for handling errors.

    **Examples:**

    .. code:: python

        remote_dir = '/home/user/remote_data'
        local_dir = '/home/user/local_downloads'

        r = yield Mget_files(
            remotepaths=f"{remote_dir}/*.log",
            localpath=local_dir,
            preserve=True,
            recurse=True,
            progress_handler=my_progress_callback
        )
        r = yield Shell(f"ls -la {local_dir}")
        print(r.cp.stdout)

    Usage:
        This class is designed to be used in a generator-based workflow where commands are yielded for execution.

    Notes:
        This implementation uses mget which supports wildcard patterns in remote paths.
