    A class to encapsulate the functionality of chdir (change directory) in
    Unix-like operating systems.

    Attributes:
        path (str): The directory path to change to.

    **Examples:**

    .. code:: python

        yield Chdir(path='/home/user/hfs')

    Usage:
        This class is designed to be used in a generator-based workflow where
        commands are yielded for execution.
