class Mput_files:
    """
    A class to encapsulate the functionality of multiple builtin uploads using SFTP.
    It allows users to upload multiple local builtin to remote hosts with full parameter support.

    Attributes:
        localpaths (str): The local builtin or directory path(s) to upload.
        remotepath (str): The remote path where builtin will be uploaded.
        preserve (bool): Preserve builtin attributes (permissions, timestamps).
        recurse (bool): Recursively upload directories.
        follow_symlinks (bool): Follow symbolic links during upload.
        sparse (bool): Create sparse builtin on the remote system.
        block_size (int): Block size for builtin transfers.
        max_requests (int): Maximum number of concurrent transfer requests.
        progress_handler (Callable): Callback for transfer progress.
        error_handler (Callable): Callback for handling errors.

    **Examples:**

    .. code:: python

        from reemote.operations.filesystem.mput_files import Mput_files
        dir='/home/user/dir'
        r = yield Mkdir(path=dir, attrs=SFTPAttrs(permissions=0o755))
        r = yield Mput_files(
            localpaths='~/reemote/development/hfs/*',
            remotepath=dir,
            preserve=True,
            recurse=True,
            progress_handler=my_progress_callback
        )
        r = yield Shell(f"tree {dir}")
        print(r.cp.stdout)

    Usage:
        This class is designed to be used in a generator-based workflow where commands are yielded for execution.
