class Callback:
    """
    A class to encapsulate the functionality of python callbacks.
    It allows users to specify an asynch callable function that is executed for all hosts.
    additional command-line options, and the ability to execute the command with elevated privileges (`sudo`).

    Attributes:

        guard (bool): If `False` the commands will not be executed.


    **Examples:**

    .. code:: python

        async def callable_function(host_info, global_info, command, cp, caller):
            if host_info["host"] == caller.host:
                print(f"callback called for host {caller.host}")

        class Demonstrate_callback:
            def execute(self):
                from reemote.operations.server.callback import Callback
                from reemote.operations.server.shell import Shell
                r = yield Shell("echo 'Hello World!'")
                print(r.cp.stdout)
                yield Callback(host="10.156.135.16", callback=callable_function)

    Usage:
        This class is designed to be used in a generator-based workflow where commands are yielded for execution.

    Notes:
        - Commands are constructed based on the `sudo`, and `su` flags.
