class Mkpasswd:
    """
    A class to encapsulate the functionality of adding a user password in Unix-like operating systems.
    It allows creating a new user account with specified password and privilege options.

    Attributes:
        password (str): The password for the new user account.
        sudo (bool): If `True`, the user will be created with `sudo` privileges.
        su (bool): If `True`, the user will be created with `su` privileges.

    **Examples:**

    .. code:: python

        yield Mkpasswd(password="secret123")

    Usage:
        This class is designed to be used in a generator-based workflow where user creation
        commands are yielded for execution on remote hosts.

    Notes:
        - Privilege escalation (sudo/su) is handled based on the respective flags.
