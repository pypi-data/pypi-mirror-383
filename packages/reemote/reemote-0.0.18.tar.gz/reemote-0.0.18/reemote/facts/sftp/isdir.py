class Isdir:
    """
    A class to encapsulate the functionality of checking if a path refers to a directory
    using SFTP isdir in Unix-like operating systems.

    Attributes:
        path: The remote path to check (can be PurePath, str, or bytes).

    **Examples:**

    .. code:: python

        yield Isdir(path="/path/to/directory")

    Usage:
        This class is designed to be used in a generator-based workflow where
        commands are yielded for execution. The boolean result for each
        host will be returned in the operation result.

    Notes:
        The operation will execute on all hosts in the current execution context.
        The path must be a valid remote path accessible via SFTP.
