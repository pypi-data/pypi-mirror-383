gc_problem_with_free: "Nearly no host tasks within {free_duration_time} microseconds(us) of free time, which is likely caused by abnormal GC of Python"

solutions:
  - memory management:
      desc: "implement effective Python memory management; release memory promptly when not in use to avoid long-term retention; avoid circular references between objects."
  - adjusting the GC threshold:
      desc: "use gc.set_threshold() to adjust the garbage collection threshold can delay garbage collection, but this is a temporary solution."
  - disable GC:
      desc: "use gc.disable() to disable GC, note that this is a temporary solution."
