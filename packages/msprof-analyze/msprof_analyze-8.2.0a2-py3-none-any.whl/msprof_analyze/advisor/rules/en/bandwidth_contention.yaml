problem: "Bandwidth Contention Analysis"
description: "The SDMA bandwidth is lower than {threshold} GB/s when computing and communication tasks are performed \n
concurrently. Generally, parallel computing and communication improves the running efficiency of the model. \n
Concurrent computing and communication tasks may affect the communication bandwidth."
sdma_baseline: 18 #M
threshold: 0.8
top_num: 10
solutions:
  - benchmark data comparison:
      desc: "compare the performance data before and after the convergence function is enabled to evaluate whether the 
      impact of bandwidth preemption exceeds the convergence benefits."
