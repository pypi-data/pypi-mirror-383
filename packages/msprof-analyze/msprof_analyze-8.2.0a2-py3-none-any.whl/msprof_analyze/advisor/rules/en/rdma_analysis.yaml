problem: "Communication Retransmission Analysis"
description: "RDMA communication retransmission occurs. A single retransmission takes more than 4s. Retransmission problems 
are detected in {group_count} communication domains. \n
Advised to perform the following suggestions"
min_retransmission_time: 4000 #ms
solutions:
  - check RDMA transmission time:
      desc: "Check whether the transmission time of the RDMA operator that is suspected to be retransmitted is correct."
  - Check the network configuration.:
      desc: "Check the network configuration of the switch and compute node server."
