# Changelog

## 0.1.1 - 2025-02-15

- Widen `httpx` dependency range to `<0.29` so downstream apps can stay on FastAPI’s default
  stack (0.28.x) without local overrides.
- No code changes—existing HTTP and auth/session tests pass against `httpx` 0.27 and 0.28.

## 0.1.0 - 2025-02-14

- First public release on PyPI under the name `spaps`.
- Adds synchronous and asynchronous clients mirroring the TypeScript SDK, including
  sessions, payments (crypto included), usage, whitelist, secure messages, and metrics helpers.
- Provides configurable retry/backoff handling, structured logging hooks, and token storage
  abstractions (in-memory & file-backed).
- Ships lint (`ruff`), type checking (`mypy`), coverage enforcement, and integration smoke
  tests wired into the release workflow.
- Updates documentation with Python quickstart examples and a dedicated backend guide.
