           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Junjo 順序

> Japanese Translation: order, sequence, procedure

Junjo is a modern Python library for designing, executing, testing, and debugging complex, graph-based AI workflows.

Whether you’re building a simple chatbot, a complex data manipulation pipeline, or a sophisticated workflow with dynamic branching and parallel execution, Junjo provides the tools to define your logic as a clear graph of nodes and edges.

#### Docs

- [Python API Docs](https://python-api.junjo.ai/)
- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/junjo/)

#### Benefits:

- Asyncio & Pydantic native
- Visualize your AI workflows
- Build in redux-inspired state machine
- Create robust and predictable conditional chains of LLM calls
- Organize complex workflow executions into a scalable clean Graph structure
- Manage execution order, loops, and concurrency
- Supports Eval-Driven Development techniques
  - Test every node of your workflow to 100% evaluation accuracy
  - Test your workflows with dozens or thousands of input cases
  - Rapidly iterate on your AI capabilities knowing for sure you're making progress
- Native opentelemetry support for clear tracing, observability, and debugging
  - Try our **optional, free, open source** companion [junjo-server](https://github.com/mdrideout/junjo-server) telemetry server.

#### Decoupled

Junjo doesn't change how you create AI / LLM calls. Use any AI or LLM service provider or library. Junjo simply helps you organize your python functions into a clean organized graph structure with predictable, testable execution.

Junjo provides the building blocks that let you make any sort of executable workflow. From linear function calls, to complex branching workflows with concurrent sublfows, to fully autonomous agents.

> 
> There are zero proprietary AI / LLM implementations in Junjo. Use whatever LLM library you want.
> 
> All logs produced are opentelemetry compatible. Existing otel spans are annotated with workflow and node execution span wrappers.
> 

It doesn't matter if the functions you add to a Junjo workflow are LLM API calls, database operations, or traditional business logic. You can write your business logic however you want. We just provide a convenient framework for organizing your desired flow into an executable graph.

### Building AI Workflows and Agents as a Graph Workflow

Agentic AI applications use LLMs to determine the order of execution of python functions. These functions may involve LLM requests, API requests, database CRUD operations, etc.

The simplest way to organize functions that can be / need to be executed in a certain order is in the form of a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph).

A directed graph gives one the building blocks to create any sort of agentic application, including:

- High precision workflows in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
- Autonomous AI Agents in the form of dynamically determined directed graphs

### Priorities

Test (eval) driven development, repeatability, debuggability, and telemetry are **CRITICAL** for rapid iteration and development of Agentic applications.

Junjo prioritizes the following capabilities above all else to ensure these things are not an afterthought. 

1. Eval driven development / Test driven development with pytest
1. Telemetry
1. Visualization
1. Type safety (pydantic)
1. Concurrency safe (asyncio)


## Contributing

This project was made with the [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) python package manager.

```bash
# Setup and activate the virtual environment
$ uv venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate

# Install optional development dependencies (graphviz is optional for running the graphviz visualizer)
# Graphviz, if utilized, must also be installed on the host system (see below)
$ uv pip install -e ".[dev,graphviz]"
```

## Visualizing Your Workflows

### Junjo Server

[Junjo Server](https://github.com/mdrideout/junjo-server) is an optional, free, open-source companion telemetry visualization platform for debugging Junjo workflows.

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Create docker-compose.yml (see docs for full example)
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Access UI at http://localhost:5153
```

**Features:**
- Interactive graph visualization with execution path tracking
- State step debugging - see every state change in chronological order
- LLM decision tracking and trace timeline
- Multi-execution comparison
- Built specifically for graph-based AI workflows

**Architecture:** Three-service Docker setup (backend, ingestion service, frontend) that runs on minimal resources (1GB RAM, shared vCPU).

See the [Junjo Server documentation](https://python-api.junjo.ai/junjo_server.html) for complete setup and configuration.

### Graphviz

Junjo can render workflow graphs as images. It requires [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) to be installed on the underlying system (your developer computer or the docker image), as well as the above optional graphviz development dependencies in this python library.

```bash
# Install Graphviz on MacOS with homebrew
$ brew install graphviz
```

```python
# visualize.py
from base.sample_workflow.graph import create_sample_workflow_graph

def main():
    # Every graph can execute .export_graphviz_assets() to generate all graphs and subflow graphs in a workflow
    # Creates .svg renderings, .dot notation files, and an HTML template to render the graphs
    create_sample_workflow_graph().export_graphviz_assets()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```bash
# Run the visualizer
python -m src.base.visualize
```

#### Full Example
**See the full example inside `examples/base`.**

## Contributing

### Code Linting and Formatting

This project utilizes [ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff) for linting and auto formatting. The VSCode settings.json in this project helps with additional formatting.

- [Ruff VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff)

### Building The Sphinx Docs

```bash
# 1. ensure optional development dependencies are installed (see above)
# 2. ensure the virtual environment is activated (see above)

# Execute the build command to preview the new docs.
# They will appear in a .gitignored folder docs/_build
$ sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build
```

### Tests

```bash
# Run the tests with uv
$ uv run pytest
```

## Code Generation

### Protobuf schema generation

1. Requires the optional `dev` dependencies to be installed via `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`
2. Requires [protoc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) which can be installed into your developer environment host machine ([instructions](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)).
3. Copy the .proto files from the junjo-server project to `src/telemetry/junjo_server/proto`
4. Run `make proto` from the project root to generate the `proto_gen` files for the client
5. Update any required changes to the `src/telemetry/junjo_server/client.py` file (type changes, fields, etc.)

### Pre-commit Hook

This project uses a pre-commit hook to automatically generate the protobuf files. To install the hook, run the following command:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
