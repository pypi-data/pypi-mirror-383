Junjo: A python library for building and managing complex Graph Workflows.

This library provides the building blocks and tools for wrapping python functions into
nodes, edges, and graphs that can be executed by a workflow.

This library also produces annotated Opentelemetry Spans to help make sense of
execution telemetry.
