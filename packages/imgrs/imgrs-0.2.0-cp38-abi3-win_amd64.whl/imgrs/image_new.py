    A high-performance image class backed by Rust.

    This class provides a Pillow-compatible API while leveraging Rust's
    performance and memory safety for all image operations.

    The class is organized using mixins for better code organization:
    - CoreMixin: I/O, constructors, properties
    - TransformMixin: Resize, crop, rotate, etc.
    - FilterMixin: All filter effects (blur, sharpen, edges, etc.)
    - PixelMixin: Pixel-level operations
    - DrawingMixin: Drawing shapes and text
    - EffectsMixin: Special effects (shadows, glow)
