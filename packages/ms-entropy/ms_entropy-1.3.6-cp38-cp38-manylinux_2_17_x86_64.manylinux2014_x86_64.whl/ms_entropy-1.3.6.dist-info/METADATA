              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Theoretical Background

`Spectral entropy` is an useful property to measure the complexity of a spectrum. It is inspried by the concept of Shannon entropy in information theory. [(ref)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01331-z)

`Entropy similarity`, which measured spectral similarity based on spectral entropy, has been shown to outperform dot product similarity in compound identification. [(ref)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01331-z)

The calculation of entropy similarity can be accelerated by using the `Flash Entropy Search` algorithm. [(ref)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-023-02012-9)

# How to use this package

This repository contains the source code to calculate spectral entropy and entropy similarity in various programming languages. Also implemented the Flash Entropy Search algorithm in Python.

## For Python users

A detailed tutorial is available here: [https://msentropy.readthedocs.io](https://msentropy.readthedocs.io)

### Installation

```bash
pip install ms_entropy
```

### Usage of Classical entropy functions

```python
import numpy as np
import ms_entropy as me

peaks_query = np.array([[69.071, 7.917962], [86.066, 1.021589], [86.0969, 100.0]], dtype = np.float32)
peaks_reference = np.array([[41.04, 37.16], [69.07, 66.83], [86.1, 999.0]], dtype = np.float32)

# Calculate entropy similarity.
entropy = me.calculate_spectral_entropy(peaks_query, clean_spectrum = True, min_ms2_difference_in_da = 0.05)
print(f"Spectral entropy is {entropy}.")

# Calculate unweighted entropy similarity.
unweighted_similarity = me.calculate_unweighted_entropy_similarity(peaks_query, peaks_reference, ms2_tolerance_in_da = 0.05)
print(f"Unweighted entropy similarity: {unweighted_similarity}.")

# Calculate entropy similarity.
similarity = me.calculate_entropy_similarity(peaks_query, peaks_reference, ms2_tolerance_in_da = 0.05)
print(f"Entropy similarity: {similarity}.")
```

### Usage of Flash Entropy Search

```python
from ms_entropy import FlashEntropySearch
entropy_search = FlashEntropySearch()
entropy_search.build_index(spectral_library)
entropy_similarity = entropy_search.search(
    precursor_mz=query_spectrum_precursor_mz, peaks=query_spectrum_peaks)
```

}

// Calculate entropy similarity
{
    int spec_a_len = 3;
    float spec_a[3][2] = {{169.071, 7.917962}, {186.066, 1.021589}, {186.0769, 100.0}};

    int spec_b_len = 3;
    float spec_b[3][2] = {{120.212, 37.16}, {169.071, 66.83}, {186.066, 999.0}};

    // The parameters for calculate_entropy_similarity function.
    int clean_spectra = 1;

    float min_mz= -1, max_mz = -1;
    float noise_threshold = 0.01;
    int max_peak_num = -1;

    // Calculate entropy similarity, the data in spec_a and spec_b will modified.
    float similarity = calculate_entropy_similarity(*spec_a, spec_a_len, *spec_b, spec_b_len, ms2_tolerance_in_da, ms2_tolerance_in_ppm, clean_spectra, min_mz, max_mz, noise_threshold, max_peak_num);
