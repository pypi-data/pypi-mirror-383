"""
Code to be run in the target environment.

This directory contains scripts and supporting modules that are supposed
to be executed in the target environment (using the Python interpreter
that the user specifies in the Preferences) instead of the environment that
Spyder runs in.

Dependencies should be kept to a minimum, because they need to be installed
in each target environment.
