class FrameworkRegistry():
    """
    Registry of testing frameworks and their associated runners.

    The test runner for a framework is responsible for running the tests and
    parsing the results. It should implement the interface of RunnerBase.

    Frameworks should first be registered using `.register()`. This registry
    can then create the assoicated test runner when `.create_runner()` is
    called.

    Attributes
    ----------
    frameworks : dict of (str, type)
        Dictionary mapping names of testing frameworks to the types of the
        associated runners.
