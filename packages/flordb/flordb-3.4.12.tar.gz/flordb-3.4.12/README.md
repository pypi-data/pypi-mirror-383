# FlorDB: Log-First Context Management for ML Practitioners

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/flordb.svg?nocache=1)](https://pypi.org/project/flordb/)


FlorDB brings experiment tracking, provenance, and reproducibility to your ML workflow‚Äîusing the one thing every engineer already writes: **logs**.

Unlike heavyweight MLOps platforms, FlorDB doesn‚Äôt ask you to adopt a new UI, schema, or service. Just import it, log as you normally would, and gain full history, lineage, and replay capabilities across your training runs.

## üöÄ Why FlorDB?

- **Log-Driven Experiment Tracking**  
  No dashboards to configure or schemas to design. FlorDB turns your existing `print()` or `log()` calls into structured, queryable metadata.

- **Hindsight Logging & Replay**  
  Missed a metric? Add a log *after the fact* and replay past runs to capture it‚Äîno rerunning from scratch.

- **Reproducibility Without Friction**  
  Every run is versioned via Git, every hyperparameter is recorded, and every model checkpoint is linked and queryable‚Äîautomatically.

- **Works With Your Stack**  
  Makefiles, Airflow, Slurm, HuggingFace, PyTorch‚Äîyou don‚Äôt change your workflow. FlorDB fits in.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install flordb
```

For contributors or bleeding-edge features:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ucbrise/flor.git
cd flor
pip install -e .
```

## üìù First Log in 30 Seconds

> *Requires a Git repository for automatic versioning.*

```bash
mkdir flor_sandbox
cd flor_sandbox
git init
ipython
```

```python
import flordb as flor
flor.log("message", "Hello ML World!")
```
```
message: Hello, ML World!
Changes committed successfully
```

Retrieve logs anytime:

```python
flor.dataframe("message")
```
```
         projid              tstamp filename          message
0  flor_sandbox 2025-10-13 18:13:48  ipython  Hello ML World!

```

## üß™ Track Experiments with Zero Overhead

Drop FlorDB into your existing training script:

```python
import flordb as flor

# Hyperparameters
lr = flor.arg("lr", 1e-3)
batch_size = flor.arg("batch_size", 32)

with flor.checkpointing(model=net, optimizer=optimizer):
    for epoch in flor.loop("epoch", range(epochs)):
        for x, y in flor.loop("step", trainloader):
            ...
            flor.log("loss", loss.item())
```

**Change hyperparameters from the CLI:**

```bash
python train.py --kwargs lr=5e-4 batch_size=64
```

View metrics across runs:

```python
flor.dataframe("lr", "batch_size", "loss")
```

```
        projid              tstamp  filename  epoch  step      lr batch_size                 loss

```


## üîç Hindsight Logging: Fix It After You See It

Forgot to log gradient norms?

```python
flor.log("grad_norm", ...)
```

Just add the logging statement to the script and run:

```bash
python -m flordb replay grad_norm
```

FlorDB replays only what‚Äôs needed, injecting the new log across copies of historical versions and committing results.

## üèó Real ML Systems Built on FlorDB

FlorDB powers full AI/ML lifecycle tooling:

- **Feature Stores & Model Registries**
- **Document Parsing & Feedback Loops**
- **Continuous Training Pipelines**

See our [Scan Studio](https://github.com/bwerick/scan_studio) and [Document Parser](https://github.com/rlnsanz/document_parser) examples for real-world integration.
