/*
 * The Wire class has concepts of 'primary' and secondary' Wire objects when they're attached.
 * These concepts only have an internal use, from an external point of view there is no
 * functional difference between a primary wire and a secondary wire.
 * The responsibilities of the primary wire are to manage the record of all secondaries and to
 * resolve the common state between all attached wires -including itself- during an update.
 * To achieve these goals, it keeps a vector of pointers to the secondary wires and a pointer to
 * primary hence the rule : "A Wire object is primary if and only if its m_primary attribute is nullptr".
 * Note : a standalone (i.e. not attached to anything) Wire object is always primary.
