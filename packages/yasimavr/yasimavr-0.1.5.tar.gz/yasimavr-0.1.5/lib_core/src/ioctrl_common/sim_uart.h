/**

   \brief Generic model defining an universal synchronous/asynchronous serial interface a.k.a. USART

   \par Emitter
   The TX part is composed of a FIFO, whose front slot is the shift register
   push_tx() puts a new 8-bits frame into the FIFO and the transmission will start
   immediately. If a TX is already in progress, the frame will wait until it can
   be transmitted. If the TX buffer size reached the limit, the most recently pushed
   frames will be discarded and the collision flag will be set.
   Frames are sent via signaling, using both UART_Data_Frame and UART_TX_Start.
   At the end of transmission, a signal UART_TX_Complete is emitted with data = 1
   if successful or 0 if canceled mid-way by a reset.
   On-going TX can only be canceled by a reset.

   \par Receiver
   The RX part is composed of a FIFO with two sub-parts: Received frames and pending frames (yet to
   be received);
   Disabling the RX does not prevent receiving frames. They are simply discarded when actually
   received by the device. (i.e. when moved from the pending FIFO to the received FIFO)
   The signal UART_RX_Start is emitted at the start of a reception.
   The signal UART_RX_Complete are emitted at the end of a reception, with data = 1 if the frame
   if kept or data = 0 if canceled or discarded.
