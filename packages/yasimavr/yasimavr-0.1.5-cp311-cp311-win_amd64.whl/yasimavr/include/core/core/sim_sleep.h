/**
   \brief Generic sleep mode controller

   It listens for the sleep instruction notification from the CPU and,
   using the register configuration, determines which sleep mode the MCU
   should enter. It then sends a CTL request to the device to enter sleep.

   It is also connected to the interrupt controller to listen to any interrupt
   raise, and determines if the interrupt is able to wake the MCU up.
   If so, it sends a CTL request to the device to exit sleep.

   This controller also manages the "pseudo-sleep" mode, which is treated as any
   other sleep mode, and which can be exited by any interrupt.

   All the configuration is done at construction by mean of a AVR_SleepConfig object.
