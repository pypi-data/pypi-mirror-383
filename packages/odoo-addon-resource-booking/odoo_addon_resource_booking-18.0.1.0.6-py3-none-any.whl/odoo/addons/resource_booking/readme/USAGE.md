This module installs a new app, "Resource bookings".

Bookings may involve you:

- Maybe because you requested to book something.
- Maybe because you are one of the booked resources, if a booking
  represents some kind of appointment.

To see which bookings involve you:

1.  Go to *Resource Bookings \> Bookings*.
2.  You can switch to the list view if you need to see also the pending
    ones.
3.  You can remove the "Involving me" filter if you want to see others'
    bookings.

To book some resources:

1.  Go to *Resource Bookings \> Types*.
2.  Pick the type of booking you want.
3.  Click on *Booking Count*.
4.  Click on a free slot.
5.  Fill the *Requester*, which may or not be yourself.
6.  Uncheck *Auto assign* and pick one *Resources combination*, in case
    the one assigned automatically isn't the one you want.

To invite someone to book a resource combination from the portal:

1.  Go to *Resource Bookings \> Types*.
2.  Pick the type of booking you want.
3.  Click on *Booking Count*.
4.  Click on the list view icon.
5.  Click on *Create*.
6.  Fill the *Requester*.
7.  Uncheck *Auto assign* and pick one *Resources combination*, if you
    want that the requester is assigned to that combination. Otherwise,
    leave it empty, and some free combination will be assigned
    automatically when the requester picks a free slot.
8.  Choose the *duration*, in case it is different from the one
    specified in the resource booking type.
9.  Click on *Share \> Send*.
10. The requester will receive an email to select a calendar slot from
    his portal.
