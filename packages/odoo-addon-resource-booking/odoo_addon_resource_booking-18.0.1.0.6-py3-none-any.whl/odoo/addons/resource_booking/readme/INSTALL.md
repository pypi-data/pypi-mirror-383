Configuration*, where he will be able to configure resources, leaves and
schedules. This menu is just provided as a shortcut. However, if you
want to manage that stuff more comfortably:

- To manage human resources, install
  [hr](https://apps.odoo.com/app/employees).
- To manage their leaves, install
  [hr_holidays](https://apps.odoo.com/app/time-off).
