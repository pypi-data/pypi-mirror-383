        where values have at least two dimensions.
        The trace is calculated on the last two dimensions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : np.ndarray or Tensor or Pwc or Stf
            The object whose trace you want to calculate, :math:`\mathop{\mathrm{Tr}}(x)`.
            Must be a matrix or a matrix-valued function.
            For arrays and tensors, the object is converted to a tensor and then
            the operation is applied. For functions of time (Pwcs and Stfs), the composition
            of the operation with the function is computed
            (that is, the operation is applied to the function values).
        name : str or None, optional
            The name of the node. You can only provide a name if the object is not an Stf.

        Returns
        -------
        Tensor or Pwc or Stf
            The trace of the last two dimension of the given matrix or matrix-valued
            function. Outputs will have two fewer dimensions.

        Calculate the Hermitian part of an object. This can be an array,
        a tensor, or a time-dependent function in the form of a Pwc or an Stf
        where values have at least two dimensions.
        The operation is applied on the last two dimensions, which must be equal to each other.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : np.ndarray or Tensor or Pwc or Stf
            The object whose Hermitian part you want to calculate, :math:`\mathop{x}`.
            Must be a matrix or a matrix-valued function.
            For arrays and tensors, the object is converted to a tensor and then
            the operation is applied. For functions of time (Pwcs and Stfs), the composition
            of the operation with the function is computed

        name : str or None, optional
            The name of the node. You can only provide a name if the object is not an Stf.

        Returns
        -------
        Tensor or Pwc or Stf
            The Hermitian part of the matrix or matrix-valued function,
            :math:`\frac{1}{2}(\mathop{x}+\mathop{x}^\dagger)`.
            Outputs will have the same dimension as the inputs.
