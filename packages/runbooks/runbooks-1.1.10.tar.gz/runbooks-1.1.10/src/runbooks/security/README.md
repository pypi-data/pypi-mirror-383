## FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions

### **1. How can I test additional security items to enhance AWS account security?**

To test a broader range of security configurations, consider using [AWS Trusted Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-trusted-advisor-new-priority-capability/).
This service regularly analyzes your AWS accounts and helps you implement AWS security best practices aligned with the AWS Well-Architected Framework. By managing your security settings through Trusted Advisor, you can systematically improve the security posture of your AWS environment.

---

### **2. Where can I find more information or guidelines to improve AWS security?**

AWS provides the [AWS Well-Architected Tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/intro.html), a comprehensive cloud service for evaluating and optimizing your architecture.
This tool includes a **Security Pillar**, which outlines detailed best practices for securing your AWS workloads. Use these guidelines to design, assess, and enhance your security strategy effectively.

---

### **3. Can I scan multiple AWS accounts within the same AWS Organization simultaneously?**

No, this script currently supports scanning a **single AWS account** at a time.
To scan additional AWS accounts in the same organization, you must:
- Create a separate IAM user with the required permissions in each account.
- Run the script individually for each account.

**Note**: Organization-level security settings cannot be assessed using this script. Consider AWS services like **AWS Organizations** for managing policies at scale.

---

### **4. Can I use this tool without an IAM Access Key?**

Yes, you can run the security assessment without an IAM Access Key by leveraging IAM roles.
The integrated `runbooks security` CLI fully supports IAM roles and various AWS authentication methods.

**Supported Authentication Methods**:
1. **IAM Roles** (Recommended): Configure and use IAM roles instead of access keys
2. **AWS SSO**: Use AWS Single Sign-On for centralized authentication
3. **Environment Variables**: Set AWS credentials via environment variables
4. **Instance Profiles**: Automatically use instance profiles when running on EC2
5. **AWS CloudShell**: Run directly in AWS CloudShell without any setup

**Setup Examples**:

**Using IAM Roles**:
1. Configure a role profile in AWS CLI: [IAM roles guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-role.html#cli-role-overview)
2. Run the assessment:
   ```bash
   runbooks security assess --profile ROLE_PROFILE_NAME --language EN
   ```

**Using AWS SSO**:
1. Configure SSO profile: `aws configure sso`
2. Run the assessment:
   ```bash
   runbooks security assess --profile sso-profile --language EN
   ```

**Using AWS CloudShell**:
```bash
pip install runbooks
runbooks security assess --language EN
```

This approach enhances security by reducing the dependency on long-term access keys and provides enterprise-grade authentication options.
