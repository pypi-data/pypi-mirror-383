AWS IAM SAML Identity Providers Discovery and Management Script

This script provides comprehensive discovery, analysis, and optional deletion capabilities for
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) SAML identity providers across multi-account
environments. It's designed for enterprise identity and access management teams who need
visibility into SAML federation configuration, identity provider governance, and automated
cleanup capabilities across large-scale AWS deployments.

Key Features:
- Multi-account SAML identity provider discovery using assume role capabilities
- Comprehensive identity provider enumeration with metadata extraction
- Optional automated deletion capabilities with safety controls
- Enterprise reporting with CSV export and structured output
- Profile-based authentication with support for federated access
- Identity provider governance for organizational security standardization

Enterprise Use Cases:
- Identity provider audit and compliance reporting across organizations
- SAML federation governance and standardization across organizational boundaries
- Identity provider lifecycle management and automated cleanup
- Security incident response with identity provider configuration analysis
- Compliance reporting for identity federation and access control standards
- Multi-account identity governance and provider consolidation
- Identity provider drift detection and configuration standardization

SAML Identity Provider Features:
- Comprehensive identity provider enumeration with ARN extraction
- Provider metadata extraction for governance and compliance analysis
- Cross-account identity provider visibility for organizational oversight
- Provider configuration analysis for security and compliance assessment
- Identity provider lifecycle tracking for governance management

Security Considerations:
- Uses IAM assume role capabilities for cross-account identity provider access
- Implements proper error handling for authorization failures
- Supports optional deletion operations with explicit safety controls
- Respects IAM service permissions and regional access constraints
- Provides comprehensive audit trail through detailed logging
- Sensitive identity configuration handling with appropriate access controls

Identity Governance Features:
- Cross-account identity provider discovery for organizational oversight
- Provider configuration standardization across organizational boundaries
- Identity provider lifecycle management with automated cleanup capabilities
- Provider governance for compliance and security standardization
- Identity federation visibility for security and compliance management

Performance Considerations:
- Sequential processing for reliable identity provider discovery operations
- Progress tracking for operational visibility during large-scale operations
- Efficient credential management for cross-account identity provider access
- Memory-optimized data structures for large identity provider inventories
- Graceful error handling for authorization and throttling scenarios

Deletion Safety Features:
- Explicit deletion flags (+delete +forreal) for safety controls
- No confirmation prompts - requires explicit command-line flags
- Comprehensive logging of deletion operations for audit trails
- Error handling for deletion failures and authorization issues
- Deletion operation tracking for compliance and governance

Threading Architecture:
- Currently uses sequential processing for reliable operations
- TODO: Multi-threading enhancement planned for improved performance
- Thread-safe error handling and progress tracking architecture
- Graceful degradation for account access failures

Dependencies:
- boto3/botocore for AWS IAM API interactions
- account_class for AWS account access management
- ArgumentsClass for standardized CLI argument parsing
- Inventory_Modules for common utility functions and credential management
- colorama for enhanced output formatting

Compliance and Audit Features:
- Comprehensive identity provider discovery for security auditing
- Provider configuration analysis for compliance validation
- Cross-account identity governance for organizational security
- Provider lifecycle tracking for organizational oversight
- Identity federation visibility for compliance assessment

Future Enhancements:
- Multi-threading for improved performance across large organizations
- Identity provider configuration analysis and drift detection
- Integration with AWS Config for provider configuration monitoring
- Provider optimization recommendations for security and compliance
