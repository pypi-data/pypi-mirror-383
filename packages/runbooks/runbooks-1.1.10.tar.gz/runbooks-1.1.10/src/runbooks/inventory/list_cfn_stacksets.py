AWS CloudFormation StackSets Discovery and Analysis Script

This script provides comprehensive discovery and analysis capabilities for AWS CloudFormation
StackSets across multi-account AWS Organizations environments. It's designed for enterprise
cloud governance teams who need visibility into multi-account infrastructure deployment patterns,
StackSet lifecycle management, and centralized infrastructure orchestration across organizational
boundaries with detailed instance enumeration and operational oversight.

Key Features:
- Multi-account CloudFormation StackSet discovery using assume role capabilities
- Cross-region StackSet enumeration with comprehensive metadata extraction
- StackSet instance counting and detailed deployment analysis
- Fragment-based search for targeted StackSet discovery and filtering
- Status-based filtering for active and deleted StackSet lifecycle tracking
- Single-profile authentication with support for federated Organizations access
- Enterprise reporting with CSV export and structured output

Enterprise Use Cases:
- Multi-account infrastructure governance and StackSet portfolio management
- Centralized deployment pattern analysis and standardization oversight
- StackSet lifecycle tracking for operational excellence and compliance
- Infrastructure drift detection through StackSet status monitoring
- Cost optimization through StackSet deployment pattern analysis
- Compliance auditing for multi-account infrastructure governance
- Disaster recovery planning through StackSet deployment topology mapping

StackSet Management Features:
- Comprehensive StackSet enumeration with status and metadata tracking
- StackSet instance discovery with detailed deployment topology analysis
- Fragment-based search for targeted StackSet identification and management
- Status filtering for active, deleted, and lifecycle transition tracking
- Cross-account StackSet visibility for organizational infrastructure oversight
- Regional StackSet deployment pattern analysis and optimization

Security Considerations:
- Uses assume role capabilities for cross-account StackSet discovery
- Implements proper error handling for authorization failures
- Supports read-only operations with no StackSet modification capabilities
- Respects CloudFormation permissions and regional access constraints
- Provides comprehensive audit trail through detailed logging
- Sensitive infrastructure information handling with appropriate access controls

Performance Considerations:
- Sequential processing for reliable StackSet discovery operations
- Optional StackSet instance enumeration with performance timing metrics
- Progress tracking for operational visibility during discovery
- Efficient credential management for cross-account StackSet access
- Memory-optimized data structures for large StackSet inventories

StackSet Instance Analysis:
- Optional detailed instance enumeration for deployment topology mapping
- Instance count tracking for capacity planning and optimization
- Cross-account instance distribution analysis for governance oversight
- Regional instance deployment pattern analysis and standardization
- Instance status tracking for operational excellence and monitoring

Dependencies:
- boto3/botocore for AWS CloudFormation StackSets API interactions
- account_class for AWS account access management
- ArgumentsClass for standardized CLI argument parsing
- Inventory_Modules for common utility functions and StackSet discovery
- colorama for enhanced output formatting

Compliance and Audit Features:
- Comprehensive StackSet discovery for infrastructure governance auditing
- StackSet deployment pattern analysis for compliance validation
- Cross-account infrastructure visibility for organizational security oversight
- StackSet lifecycle tracking for governance and compliance management
- Infrastructure standardization analysis for organizational oversight

Future Enhancements:
- Multi-threading for improved performance across large organizations
- StackSet drift detection and configuration analysis
- Integration with AWS Config for StackSet configuration monitoring
- StackSet optimization recommendations for governance and cost management
