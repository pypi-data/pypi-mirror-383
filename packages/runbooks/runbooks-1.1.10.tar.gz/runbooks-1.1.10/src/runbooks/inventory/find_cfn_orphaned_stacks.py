AWS CloudFormation Orphaned Stack Detection and Analysis Script

This enterprise-grade script provides comprehensive detection and analysis of orphaned CloudFormation
stacks across multi-account AWS Organizations environments. Designed for infrastructure teams managing
CloudFormation StackSets at scale, offering automated orphaned stack identification, cross-account
stack reconciliation, and organizational governance support for infrastructure cleanup and compliance.

Key Features:
    - Multi-account, multi-region CloudFormation stack and StackSet reconciliation
    - Orphaned stack instance detection comparing StackSet definitions with deployed stacks
    - Fragment-based filtering for targeted orphaned stack analysis
    - Comprehensive cross-account stack inventory and comparison analysis
    - Enterprise governance support with account exclusion and targeted analysis
    - Multi-threaded processing for efficient large-scale stack discovery

Orphaned Stack Detection:
    - Cross-references StackSet instances in management account with actual stacks in member accounts
    - Identifies StackSet instances that exist in management account but not in target accounts
    - Discovers stacks in member accounts that are not managed by any StackSet
    - Provides detailed mismatch analysis for infrastructure cleanup and governance
    - Supports fragment-based filtering for targeted orphaned stack identification

Authentication & Access:
    - AWS Organizations support for centralized StackSet and stack management
    - Cross-account role assumption for organizational stack visibility
    - Regional validation and multi-region support for comprehensive coverage
    - Profile-based authentication with comprehensive credential management

Performance & Scalability:
    - Multi-threaded stack discovery for efficient large-scale processing
    - Progress tracking and performance metrics for operational visibility
    - Efficient credential management for multi-account stack enumeration
    - Memory-efficient processing for extensive StackSet and stack inventories

Enterprise Use Cases:
    - Infrastructure cleanup and orphaned resource identification
    - StackSet governance and stack instance lifecycle management
    - Organizational compliance monitoring and drift detection
    - Infrastructure migration and consolidation planning
    - Automated cleanup recommendation generation

Security & Compliance:
    - Account exclusion capabilities preventing analysis on sensitive accounts
    - Comprehensive audit logging for stack analysis and discovery operations
    - Regional access validation and opt-in status verification
    - Safe credential handling with automatic session management

Historical Context:
    This script was originally created to support the "move_stack_instances.py" script by providing
    recovery capabilities for stack instances that might be lost during StackSet migration operations.
    While the move script now has built-in recovery, this script remains valuable for identifying
    and analyzing orphaned stack instances that may occur during normal StackSet operations.

Dependencies:
    - boto3: AWS SDK for CloudFormation and StackSet API access
    - colorama: Terminal output formatting and colored display
    - Custom modules: Inventory_Modules, ArgumentsClass, account_class for enterprise operations

Output Format:
    - Comprehensive tabular analysis of orphaned stack instances
    - Separate reporting for parent StackSet instances and child stacks
    - Performance timing metrics and operational summaries
    - Optional file export for further analysis and reporting

        3. Identify parent StackSet instances without corresponding child stacks (missing deployments)

        5. Filter child stacks to include only StackSet-managed stacks (StackSet- prefix)
        6. Generate comprehensive reports for infrastructure cleanup and governance

    Orphaned Stack Detection:
        - Parent instances not in child stacks indicate failed or missing StackSet deployments
        - Child stacks not in parent instances indicate orphaned StackSet-managed resources
        - Cross-account stack reconciliation ensuring organizational infrastructure alignment
        - Performance timing for large-scale reconciliation operations

    Reporting & Display:
