# Inventory Module - Microsoft Spec Kit Pilot (4-Day Framework)

> **🎯 MISSION**: Working software validation achieving ≥99.5% test coverage through systematic specification-driven development

---

## 🚨 SECTION 1: PILOT OVERVIEW & ACCOUNTABILITY

### Mission Statement
**4-Day Microsoft Spec Kit Pilot** for Inventory module achieving measurable success:
- **Working Software**: All 46 scripts operational with comprehensive specifications
- **Test Excellence**: ≥99.5% test coverage (current: 80.4% / 37 of 46 scripts)
- **Evidence-Based Validation**: MCP cross-validation + real AWS profile testing
- **Zero Ambiguity**: Specification clarity eliminating implementation guesswork

### Manager Accountability Context
**Historical Failures Driving This Pilot**:

```yaml
sprint_1_7_finops_failure:
  violation: "Comprehensive documentation without production-ready software"
  pattern: "NATO (No Action, Talk Only) - claims without delivery"
  impact: "Manager skepticism, trust erosion, credibility loss"
  lesson: "Working software > comprehensive documentation"

story_2_5_vpc_failure:
  violation: "Incomplete validation, phantom completion claims"
  pattern: "Test framework gaps, no MCP cross-validation"
  impact: "Delivery without quality assurance, broken commitments"
  lesson: "Evidence-based completion mandatory, never claim done without proof"

pilot_mandate:
  requirement: "Prove specifications enable delivery, not just describe it"
  timeline: "4 days (not 2-4 weeks) - manager watching with skepticism"
  success: "Rebuild trust through measurable working software delivery"
```

### Success Definition (All 3 Required)
1. **Working Software**: ≥99.5% test success rate (37/46 → 46/46 scripts operational)
2. **Specification Quality**: 0 ambiguity errors, comprehensive coverage for all 46 scripts
3. **Systematic Delegation**: 100% Task tool coordination, no standalone implementation

---

## 🚨 SECTION 2: MANAGER-APPROVED PILOT PARAMETERS

### AWS Profile Configuration (Real Data Required)
**Multi-Account Profiles** (Organizations context):
```bash
MANAGEMENT_PROFILE="management-account-profile"      # Organization root access
BILLING_PROFILE="billing-account-profile"            # Cost Explorer API access
CENTRALISED_OPS_PROFILE="centralised-ops-profile"    # Cross-account operations
```

**Single-Account Profile** (Testing context):
```bash
TEST_SRE_PROFILE="test-sre-profile"                  # Autonomous validation
```

**Validation Requirement**: All scripts MUST use real AWS profiles, no mock data tolerated.

### Success Metrics (≥99.5% FAANG Standard)
```yaml
test_coverage:
  baseline: "80.4% (37 of 46 scripts passing)"
  target: "≥99.5% (46 of 46 scripts passing)"
  measurement: "Autonomous test framework validation"
  evidence: "Test execution logs with pass/fail line numbers"

specification_clarity:
  baseline: "0 specifications (pilot start)"
  target: "46 comprehensive specifications (100% coverage)"
  measurement: "Zero ambiguity errors during implementation"
  evidence: "Developer comprehension validation, no clarification requests"

delegation_compliance:
  baseline: "Framework operational"
  target: "100% systematic delegation"
  measurement: "Task tool invocations for ALL implementation work"
  evidence: "Coordination audit trail, zero standalone violations"

specification_overhead:
  baseline: "0% (no specs exist)"
  target: "<30% of implementation time"
  measurement: "Spec writing time vs coding time ratio"
  abort_trigger: "If spec overhead >30%, pilot considered failed"
```

### Abort Criteria (Rollback Triggers)
**Immediate Pilot Termination If**:
1. **Test Regression**: Coverage drops below 80.4% baseline
2. **Timeline Breach**: Pilot exceeds 4 calendar days
3. **Coordination Failures**: Systematic delegation violations detected
4. **Spec Overhead**: Specification effort exceeds 30% of implementation time
5. **Manager Directive**: Manager determines pilot not achieving objectives

### Coordination Logistics
**Daily Standups**: 5 days/week (Monday-Friday) with evidence-based status updates
- **Format**: Yesterday | Today | Blockers (with file evidence)
- **Delivery**: End-of-day summary with completion proof
- **Escalation**: Immediate manager notification if abort criteria approached

---

## 🚨 SECTION 4: ENTERPRISE COORDINATION FRAMEWORK

### NEVER Standalone Mode Policy
**product-owner ALWAYS ACTIVE** (session start → session end):
- **Auto-Activation**: Strategic lead initialized at every session start
- **Continuous Oversight**: All phases require product-owner coordination
- **Violation Detection**: Response without product-owner coordination = IMMEDIATE ESCALATION
- **Evidence Requirement**: product-owner approval mandatory for all deliverables

### Agent Selection Matrix
**Systematic Delegation Based on Work Type**:

```yaml
technical_implementation:
  agent: "python-engineer"
  scope: "AWS integration, CLI frameworks, boto3 code"
  deliverables: "src/runbooks/inventory/*.py files"
  coordination: "product-owner oversight + qa-testing validation"

architecture_design:
  agent: "cloud-architect"
  scope: "Multi-account strategy, compliance patterns, infrastructure design"
  deliverables: ".specify/memory/enterprise-constitution.md"
  coordination: "product-owner strategic alignment + security review"

quality_assurance:
  agent: "qa-testing-specialist"
  scope: "Test framework (80.4% → ≥99.5%), validation strategies, MCP cross-check"
  deliverables: "tests/ validation + artifacts/spec-kit-pilot/day-1-validation.md"
  coordination: "product-owner approval gates + evidence collection"

security_compliance:
  agent: "devops-security-engineer"
  scope: "Security baselines, compliance automation, audit trails"
  deliverables: "Security validation frameworks + compliance evidence"
  coordination: "product-owner risk assessment + regulatory review"

documentation:
  agent: "technical-documentation-engineer"
  scope: "Specifications, guides, API documentation"
  deliverables: "CLAUDE.md + .specify/specs/inventory-module-spec.md"
  coordination: "product-owner business value validation + clarity review"

strategic_oversight:
  agent: "product-owner (ALWAYS ACTIVE)"
  scope: "Business value, coordination, approval gates, evidence-based completion"
  deliverables: "Strategic validation + manager communication + pilot success metrics"
  coordination: "Continuous leadership across all phases"
```

### Systematic Delegation Requirements
**Task Tool MANDATORY for ALL Implementation**:

```yaml
violation_patterns_forbidden:
  - "I will create..." ❌ → "Coordinating technical-documentation-engineer to create..." ✅
  - "I have installed..." ❌ → "python-engineer initialized via Task tool (evidence: .specify/ exists)" ✅
  - "Let me write..." ❌ → "Delegating to cloud-architect for specification (Task tool invocation)" ✅
  - "I fixed the bug..." ❌ → "python-engineer resolved issue (evidence: git diff lines 45-67)" ✅

correct_delegation_pattern:
  step_1: "Strategic assessment (product-owner analysis)"
  step_2: "Coordinate via Task tool (delegate to specialist)"
  step_3: "Validate deliverable (qa-testing verification)"
  step_4: "Business value confirmation (product-owner approval)"
```

### Violation Detection Patterns
**Automated Monitoring for**:
- **Standalone Responses**: Response without agent coordination
- **Direct Implementation**: File modifications without Task tool delegation
- **Completion Claims**: Success statements without evidence (file verification, line numbers)
- **Test Bypass**: Deployment without `/test` command integration
- **Context Loss**: Responses missing 5 Strategic Objectives reference

## 🚨 SECTION 7: QUALITY GATES & STANDARDS

### ≥99.5% FAANG Standard Enforcement
**Non-Negotiable Quality Requirements**:

```yaml
test_coverage:
  standard: "≥99.5% (FAANG industry benchmark)"
  measurement: "pytest pass rate across 46 scripts"
  enforcement: "No pilot completion until ≥99.5% achieved"
  evidence: "Complete test execution logs"

specification_quality:
  standard: "0 ambiguity errors (developer comprehension)"
  measurement: "Implementation without clarification requests"
  enforcement: "Specification revisions until 0 ambiguity"
  evidence: "Developer validation feedback"

systematic_delegation:
  standard: "100% Task tool coordination"
  measurement: "Audit trail of all implementation work"
  enforcement: "Violation detection triggers corrective action"
  evidence: "Task tool invocation logs"
```

### Zero Ambiguity Tolerance
**Specification Clarity Standards**:

```yaml
ambiguity_definition:
  criterion_1: "Developer requires clarification during implementation"
  criterion_2: "Multiple interpretation possibilities exist"
  criterion_3: "Input/output expectations unclear"
  criterion_4: "Validation criteria not measurable"

ambiguity_prevention:
  approach: "Explicit inputs, outputs, validation criteria"
  validation: "Developer dry-run before implementation"
  iteration: "Specification refinement until 0 ambiguity"
  evidence: "Implementation proceeds without questions"
```

### 100% Systematic Delegation Requirement
**Coordination Compliance**:

```yaml
delegation_standards:
  requirement: "ALL implementation via Task tool"
  prohibition: "No direct Write/Edit/Bash for code changes"
  pattern: "product-owner → specialist agent → validation → approval"
  evidence: "Complete audit trail with agent invocations"

violation_consequences:
  detection: "Automated monitoring for standalone operations"
  escalation: "Immediate product-owner notification"
  correction: "Remediation with framework compliance"
  documentation: "Lessons learned integration"
```

### Evidence-Based Completion Standards
**Proof Requirements for ALL Claims**:

```yaml
file_evidence:
  requirement: "File verification with specific line numbers"
  format: "git diff showing exact changes"
  prohibition: "No abstract summaries, concrete evidence only"
  example: "git diff src/runbooks/inventory/list_ec2_instances.py lines 45-67"

test_evidence:
  requirement: "Complete pytest execution logs"
  format: "Pass/fail status with line number references"
  prohibition: "No claims without test framework proof"
  example: "pytest tests/inventory/test_ec2.py::test_list_instances PASSED"

mcp_evidence:
  requirement: "Cross-validation accuracy reports"
  format: "Script output vs AWS ground truth comparison"
  prohibition: "No completion without MCP validation"
  example: "MCP validation: 46/46 scripts ≥99.5% accuracy"
```

---

## 🚨 SECTION 8: LESSONS LEARNED INTEGRATION

### NATO Prevention (No Action, Talk Only)
**Historical Violation Pattern**:

```yaml
sprint_1_7_failure:
  violation: "Comprehensive documentation without working software"
  pattern: "Extensive planning, minimal delivery"
  impact: "Manager skepticism, broken trust"

corrective_action:
  principle: "Working software over comprehensive documentation"
  validation: "Evidence-based completion (file verification, line numbers)"
  enforcement: "NEVER claim done without executable proof"
  pilot_integration: "≥99.5% test success = working software proof"
```

### Documentation ≠ Working Software
**Critical Distinction**:

```yaml
documentation_trap:
  problem: "Beautiful specs without functional code"
  consequence: "Wasted effort, no business value"
  detection: "High documentation volume, low test coverage"

working_software_definition:
  criterion_1: "Code executes without errors"
  criterion_2: "Tests pass at ≥99.5% rate"
  criterion_3: "Real AWS profiles validate functionality"
  criterion_4: "MCP cross-validation confirms accuracy"

pilot_approach:
  balance: "Specifications enable implementation, not replace it"
  measurement: "Spec overhead <30% of implementation time"
  validation: "Working software delivered by Day 4"
```

### Manager Trust Rebuilding Requirements
**Credibility Restoration Strategy**:

```yaml
trust_erosion_causes:
  sprint_failures: "7 sprints (Sprint 1-7) with incomplete delivery"
  story_failures: "Story 2.5 (VPC) phantom completion claims"
  pattern: "Repeated promises, insufficient follow-through"

trust_rebuilding_actions:
  evidence_based: "Show file changes, test results, AWS validation"
  timeline_discipline: "4-day commitment with daily proof"
  systematic_approach: "No shortcuts, comprehensive coordination"
  manager_visibility: "Daily standups with concrete evidence"

pilot_as_proof:
  objective: "Demonstrate specifications enable delivery"
  measurement: "≥99.5% test success achieved in 4 days"
  validation: "Manager decision gate on Day 4"
  outcome: "Rebuild credibility through measurable results"
```

### Previous Failure Analysis (Why Sprint 1-7 & Story 2.5 Failed)
**Root Cause Analysis**:

```yaml
sprint_1_7_finops:
  root_cause: "Documentation bias over executable delivery"
  symptoms: "Extensive plans, incomplete implementations"
  consequences: "Manager frustration, deadline misses"
  lesson: "Deliver working software first, document second"

story_2_5_vpc:
  root_cause: "Insufficient validation before completion claims"
  symptoms: "Test framework gaps, no MCP cross-validation"
  consequences: "Phantom completions, broken functionality"
  lesson: "Evidence-based completion mandatory, never claim without proof"

systemic_issues:
  issue_1: "Standalone mode operations (missing agent coordination)"
  issue_2: "NATO patterns (talk without action)"
  issue_3: "Completion claims without file verification"
  issue_4: "Test bypasses (deployment without validation)"

pilot_corrections:
  coordination: "100% systematic delegation (Task tool mandatory)"
  validation: "≥99.5% test success before completion"
  evidence: "File verification, line numbers, MCP cross-check"
  accountability: "Daily standups with concrete proof"
```
