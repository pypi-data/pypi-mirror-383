AWS Lambda Function Inventory and Runtime Management Tool

A comprehensive Lambda function discovery and runtime management tool for multi-account
AWS Organizations that provides detailed serverless infrastructure visibility and
automated runtime upgrade capabilities across all accounts and regions.

**AWS API Mapping**: 
- `boto3.client('lambda').list_functions()`
- `boto3.client('lambda').update_function_configuration()`

**RUNTIME UPGRADE CAPABILITY**: This script can perform LIVE updates to Lambda function
runtimes, making it critical for security patching and compliance maintenance.

Features:
    - Multi-account Lambda function discovery via AWS Organizations
    - Runtime version inventory and compliance analysis
    - Automated runtime upgrade with safety controls
    - Fragment-based function filtering for targeted operations
    - Comprehensive error handling and rollback capabilities
    - Runtime usage analytics and deprecation warnings

Serverless Governance Use Cases:
    - Runtime compliance auditing and security patching
    - Automated migration to supported Lambda runtimes
    - Function inventory and dependency analysis
    - Cost optimization through runtime efficiency assessment
    - Security vulnerability remediation (deprecated runtimes)
    - Compliance validation for regulatory requirements

Compatibility:
    - AWS Organizations with cross-account roles
    - AWS Control Tower managed accounts
    - Standalone AWS accounts
    - All AWS regions including opt-in regions
    - All Lambda runtime families (Python, Node.js, Java, .NET, Go, Ruby)

**SECURITY WARNING**: Runtime updates can affect function behavior:
- Test runtime changes in non-production environments first
- Verify function compatibility with target runtime
- Monitor function execution after runtime upgrades
- Maintain proper backup and rollback procedures

Example:
    Discover all Lambda functions across organization:
    ```bash
    python list_lambda_functions.py --profile my-org-profile
    ```
    
    Find functions with deprecated Python 3.8 runtime:
    ```bash
    python list_lambda_functions.py --profile my-profile --runtime python3.8
    ```
    
    Upgrade Python 3.8 functions to Python 3.11:
    ```bash
    python list_lambda_functions.py --profile my-profile \
        --runtime python3.8 --new_runtime python3.11 --fix
    ```

Requirements:
    - IAM permissions: `lambda:ListFunctions`, `lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration`, `sts:AssumeRole`
    - AWS Organizations access (for multi-account scanning)
    - Python 3.8+ with required dependencies

            - Values < 50: Enable summary statistics and progress information
            - Values >= 50: Minimal output for automated processing
            - Default 50 provides balanced operational visibility

    Args:
        fAllFunctions (list): Lambda functions requiring runtime updates containing:

    **ENTERPRISE SAFETY CONTROLS**:

        - Interactive user confirmation for destructive operations (unless forced)
        - Comprehensive error handling and rollback logging
        - Performance timing for operational SLA compliance
        - Audit trail generation for enterprise compliance requirements

    Runtime Upgrade Safety Features:

        - Performance Monitoring: Operation timing for SLA and capacity planning
        - Error Recovery: Graceful failure handling with detailed diagnostics

    Enterprise Operational Workflows:
        - Security Patching: Automated migration from vulnerable runtime versions
        - Compliance Maintenance: Bulk runtime updates for regulatory requirements
        - Performance Optimization: Upgrade to more efficient runtime versions
        - Cost Optimization: Migration to cost-effective runtime configurations
        - Deprecation Management: Proactive migration from end-of-life runtimes
