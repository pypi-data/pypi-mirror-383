AWS VPC Subnet Inventory and IP Utilization Analysis Script

This script provides comprehensive discovery, analysis, and reporting capabilities for
AWS VPC subnets across multiple accounts and regions. It's designed for enterprise
networking teams who need visibility into subnet utilization, IP address allocation,
and network architecture across large-scale AWS deployments.

Key Features:
- Multi-account VPC subnet discovery using assume role capabilities
- Multi-region scanning with configurable region targeting
- IP address allocation tracking and utilization analysis
- Subnet exhaustion detection with configurable thresholds
- Parallel processing with optimized threading for large environments
- IP address search capabilities for network troubleshooting
- Comprehensive subnet metadata extraction and reporting
- Enterprise reporting with CSV export and structured output
- Profile-based authentication with support for federated access

Enterprise Use Cases:
- Network capacity planning and IP address management (IPAM)
- Subnet utilization monitoring and exhaustion prevention
- Multi-account network architecture documentation
- IP address conflict detection and resolution
- Network security auditing and compliance reporting
- Cost optimization through subnet consolidation analysis
- Disaster recovery planning for network infrastructure

Network Analysis Features:
- IP utilization percentage calculation with exhaustion alerts
- Available IP address counting across subnet ranges
- VPC-level aggregation for architectural analysis
- CIDR block overlap detection and validation
- Network segmentation compliance verification
- Subnet naming convention analysis and standardization

Security Considerations:
- Uses IAM assume role capabilities for cross-account access
- Implements proper error handling for authorization failures
- Supports read-only operations with no network modification capabilities
- Respects VPC and subnet access permissions
- Provides comprehensive audit trail through detailed logging

Performance Optimizations:
- Multi-threaded processing with configurable worker pools
- Queue-based work distribution for load balancing
- Progress tracking with real-time feedback
- API rate limiting respect to prevent throttling
- Efficient memory usage for large subnet inventories

Future Enhancements:
- Elastic IP address integration for complete IP visibility
- Network ACL and security group association analysis
- Route table mapping and traffic flow analysis
- ENI (Elastic Network Interface) inventory integration

Dependencies:
- boto3/botocore for AWS VPC API interactions
- Threading support for concurrent processing
- Inventory_Modules for common utility functions
- ArgumentsClass for standardized CLI argument parsing
