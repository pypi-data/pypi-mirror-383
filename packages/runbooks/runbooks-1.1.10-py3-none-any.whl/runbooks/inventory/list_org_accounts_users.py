AWS Organizations User Inventory Discovery Script

This script provides comprehensive discovery and enumeration capabilities for user accounts
across AWS Organizations environments, supporting both traditional IAM users and modern
AWS Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) user management. It's designed for enterprise
identity and access management teams who need complete visibility into user distribution,
access patterns, and identity governance across large-scale multi-account deployments.

**AWS API Mapping**: `iam.list_users()`, `identitystore.list_users()`, `sso-admin.list_instances()`

Key Features:
- Multi-account user discovery using assume role capabilities across AWS Organizations
- Dual identity source support: IAM users and AWS Identity Center users
- Comprehensive user metadata extraction with last access tracking
- Cross-account user enumeration with organizational hierarchy mapping
- Identity Center directory deduplication for efficient discovery
- Multi-format export (JSON, CSV, Markdown, Table)
- Profile-based authentication with support for federated access

Architecture (v1.1.10):
    - Group-level with --all-profiles pattern (Option B)
    - Shared utilities integration (organizations_utils.py + output_formatters.py)
    - Modern CLI + Legacy Python Main dual compatibility
    - Rich CLI output with enterprise UX standards

Enterprise Use Cases:
- Identity governance and user access auditing across organizations
- User lifecycle management and access certification processes
- Security compliance reporting for identity and access management
- Identity consolidation analysis and migration planning
- Multi-account user access patterns and behavioral analysis
- Identity Center adoption tracking and governance oversight
- User account sprawl detection and cleanup initiatives

Identity Management Features:
- IAM user discovery with comprehensive metadata extraction including:
  - User creation dates and last password usage tracking
  - Access key status and last activity monitoring
  - Policy attachments and group membership analysis
- AWS Identity Center user enumeration with directory awareness including:
  - Identity Center user profiles and attributes
  - Directory instance discovery and deduplication
  - User provisioning status and access tracking
- Cross-account identity correlation for governance oversight

Security Considerations:
- Uses IAM assume role capabilities for cross-account user discovery
- Implements proper error handling for authorization failures
- Supports read-only operations with no user modification capabilities
- Respects identity service permissions and regional access constraints
- Provides comprehensive audit trail through detailed logging
- Sensitive user information handling with appropriate access controls

Identity Center Integration:
- Automatic discovery of Identity Center directory instances
- Directory deduplication to prevent duplicate user enumeration
- Support for multiple Identity Center instances across organization
- Integration with Identity Center user provisioning and lifecycle management
- Identity Center user attribute and profile extraction

Performance Considerations:
- Sequential processing for reliable user discovery operations
- Progress tracking for operational visibility during large-scale enumeration
- Efficient credential management for cross-account user access
- Memory-optimized data structures for large user inventories
- Directory deduplication to optimize Identity Center discovery performance

Threading Architecture:
- Currently uses sequential processing for reliable operations
- TODO: Multi-threading enhancement planned for improved performance
- Thread-safe error handling and progress tracking architecture
- Graceful degradation for account access failures

Dependencies:
- boto3/botocore for AWS IAM and Identity Center API interactions
- ArgumentsClass for standardized CLI argument parsing
- Inventory_Modules for common utility functions and credential management
- Rich CLI for enhanced output formatting
- Progress bars for discovery tracking

Compliance and Audit Features:
- Comprehensive user discovery for identity governance auditing
- User access pattern analysis for compliance validation
- Cross-account user visibility for organizational security oversight
- Identity lifecycle tracking for governance and compliance management
- User attribute and metadata extraction for compliance reporting

Example (Modern CLI):
    Multi-account user discovery:
    ```bash
    runbooks inventory --all-profiles $MANAGEMENT_PROFILE list-org-users
    ```

    Brief listing with timing:
    ```bash
    runbooks inventory --profile mgmt list-org-users --short --timing
    ```

    Identity Center only:
    ```bash
    runbooks inventory --profile mgmt list-org-users --idc --export-format csv
    ```

Example (Legacy Python Main):
    ```bash
    python src/runbooks/inventory/list_org_accounts_users.py --profile my-org-profile
    python src/runbooks/inventory/list_org_accounts_users.py --profile my-profile --idc
    python src/runbooks/inventory/list_org_accounts_users.py --rootonly --iam
    ```

Future Enhancements:
- Multi-threading for improved performance across large organizations
- User access pattern analysis and behavioral analytics
- Integration with AWS CloudTrail for user activity correlation
- User optimization recommendations for identity governance
