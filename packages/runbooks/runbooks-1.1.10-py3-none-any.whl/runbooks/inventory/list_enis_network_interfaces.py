AWS Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI) Discovery and Analysis Script

This script provides comprehensive discovery and inventory capabilities for AWS Elastic
Network Interfaces (ENIs) across multiple accounts and regions. It's designed for enterprise
network teams who need visibility into network interface distribution, IP address management,
and network security analysis across large-scale AWS deployments.

Key Features:
- Multi-account ENI discovery using assume role capabilities
- Multi-region scanning with configurable region targeting
- IP address search and tracking for network forensics and management
- Public IP filtering for security posture analysis
- ENI status monitoring for cost optimization (unused ENIs detection)
- Enterprise reporting with CSV export and structured output
- Profile-based authentication with support for federated access

Enterprise Use Cases:
- Network inventory and IP address management (IPAM) across organizations
- Security analysis for public IP exposure and network attack surface
- Cost optimization through detection of unused network interfaces
- Network forensics and IP address tracking for incident response
- Compliance reporting for network security and configuration standards
- Multi-account network architecture documentation and governance
- Capacity planning for network interface allocation and utilization

Network Interface Analysis Features:
- ENI enumeration with attachment status and configuration details
- IP address tracking for both private and public allocations
- VPC and subnet association analysis for network topology mapping
- Security group and network ACL configuration visibility
- DNS name resolution and endpoint management
- Network interface lifecycle and cost optimization analysis

Security Considerations:
- Uses IAM assume role capabilities for cross-account ENI access
- Implements proper error handling for authorization failures
- Supports read-only operations with no network interface modification capabilities
- Respects EC2 service permissions and regional access constraints
- Provides comprehensive audit trail through detailed logging
- Sensitive IP address information handling with appropriate access controls

IP Address Management Features:
- Targeted IP address search for network forensics and tracking
- Public IP enumeration for security assessment and compliance
- Private IP allocation analysis for network capacity planning
- ENI attachment status for resource utilization tracking
- Cross-account IP address correlation and conflict detection

Performance Considerations:
- Multi-threaded processing for concurrent ENI API operations
- Progress tracking with tqdm for operational visibility during long operations
- Efficient credential management for cross-account network access
- Memory-optimized data structures for large network interface inventories
- Queue-based worker architecture for scalable discovery operations

Threading Architecture:
- Worker thread pool with configurable concurrency (max 50 threads for ENI APIs)
- Queue-based task distribution for efficient network interface discovery
- Thread-safe error handling and progress tracking
- Graceful degradation for account access failures

Dependencies:
- boto3/botocore for AWS EC2 ENI API interactions
- Inventory_Modules for common utility functions and credential management
- ArgumentsClass for standardized CLI argument parsing
- threading and queue for concurrent processing architecture
- colorama for enhanced output formatting and tqdm for progress tracking

Cost Optimization Features:
- Detection of detached ENIs that incur charges without providing value
- ENI lifecycle analysis for resource optimization recommendations
- Public IP usage tracking for cost management
- Network interface utilization reporting for capacity planning

Future Enhancements:
- ENI security group analysis and compliance checking
- Network traffic analysis integration for performance optimization
- Automated ENI cleanup recommendations for cost reduction
- Integration with AWS Config for network configuration drift detection
