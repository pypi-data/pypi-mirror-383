AWS IAM Role Inventory and Management Tool

CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING: This script can DELETE IAM roles across multiple AWS accounts.
Exercise extreme caution when using deletion features in production environments.

Purpose:
    Discovers and inventories IAM roles across AWS Organizations with optional deletion
    capabilities. Provides comprehensive role analysis with fragment-based filtering
    and bulk management operations for enterprise IAM governance.

AWS API Operations:
    - iam.list_roles(): Primary API for role discovery
    - iam.list_attached_role_policies(): Policy attachment analysis
    - iam.detach_role_policy(): Policy detachment for deletion
    - iam.delete_role_policy(): Inline policy cleanup
    - iam.delete_role(): Role deletion operation

Destructive Operations:
    The +delete/+d flag enables IRREVERSIBLE role deletion across multiple accounts.
    Includes safety confirmations and force options for automation scenarios.

Security Features:
    - Multi-stage confirmation for destructive operations
    - Comprehensive policy detachment before role deletion
    - Force flag with delay for automation safety
    - Detailed audit logging of all operations

Usage:
    python list_iam_roles.py -p <profile> --fragment <role_name_fragment>
    python list_iam_roles.py -p <profile> --fragment <fragment> +delete

    CRITICAL SECURITY OPERATION: This function performs IRREVERSIBLE deletion
    of IAM roles including all attached policies. Must follow AWS IAM deletion

    Args:
        fRoleList (dict): Role deletion context containing:

    Security Implications:
        - Role deletion affects all services and resources using the role
        - Cannot be undone - permanent loss of role and policy associations
        - May break applications, services, or automation depending on role

    AWS IAM Constraints:
        - Cannot delete role with attached policies (managed or inline)

            - Success: Boolean indicating credential validation status

        frole_fragments (list): Optional role name fragments for filtering.
            If None, returns all roles. If provided, filters by fragment matching.

    CRITICAL SECURITY FUNCTION: This orchestrates IRREVERSIBLE deletion of IAM roles

    confirmation prompts, force flags, and detailed audit logging.

            - RoleName: IAM role name for deletion
            - AccountId: Target AWS account ID
            - Credential information for authenticated API calls

    Safety Control Flow:
        1. Fragment Validation: Refuses deletion if no role fragments specified
        2. Interactive Confirmation: Prompts user for explicit confirmation
        3. Force Mode: Automated confirmation with safety delay
        4. Individual Deletion: Calls my_delete_role() for each role
        5. Result Tracking: Updates role records with deletion status

    Security Features:
        - Prevents accidental bulk deletion without fragment specification
        - Interactive confirmation shows exact count and scope
        - Force mode includes mandatory delay allowing Ctrl-C abort
        - Per-role deletion status tracking for audit purposes
        - Comprehensive logging of all deletion attempts

    Deletion Modes:
        - Interactive Mode: User must confirm each batch deletion
        - Force Mode: Automated with {time_to_sleep} second safety delay
        - Dry Run: No deletion if pDelete flag not set

    Side Effects:
        - Modifies roles_to_delete list by adding 'Action' field

        - Displays progress and confirmation prompts to stdout

    Error Handling:
