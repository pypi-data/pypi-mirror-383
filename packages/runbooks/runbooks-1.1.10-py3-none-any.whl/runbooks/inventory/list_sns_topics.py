AWS SNS Topic Inventory Collection

A comprehensive SNS topic discovery tool for multi-account AWS Organizations that
provides detailed messaging infrastructure visibility across all accounts and regions.
Essential for event-driven architecture governance, compliance, and cost optimization.

**AWS API Mapping**: `boto3.client('sns').list_topics()`

Features:
    - Multi-account SNS topic discovery via AWS Organizations
    - Fragment-based topic filtering for targeted operations
    - Cross-region messaging topology mapping
    - Topic naming convention compliance validation
    - Comprehensive error handling and logging
    - Enterprise-grade inventory and reporting

Messaging Architecture Use Cases:
    - Event-driven architecture documentation and governance
    - Topic naming convention compliance auditing
    - Cross-account messaging topology analysis
    - Cost optimization through topic utilization assessment
    - Security assessment of topic configurations and policies
    - Migration planning for messaging infrastructure

Compatibility:
    - AWS Organizations with cross-account roles
    - AWS Control Tower managed accounts
    - Standalone AWS accounts
    - All AWS regions including opt-in regions
    - All SNS topic types (Standard and FIFO)

Example:
    Discover all SNS topics across organization:
    ```bash
    python list_sns_topics.py --profile my-org-profile
    ```
    
    Find topics with specific naming pattern:
    ```bash
    python list_sns_topics.py --profile my-profile --fragment "alert"
    ```
    
    Export topic inventory to file:
    ```bash
    python list_sns_topics.py --profile my-profile \
        --save sns_inventory.json --output json
    ```

Requirements:
    - IAM permissions: `sns:ListTopics`, `sts:AssumeRole`
    - AWS Organizations access (for multi-account scanning)
    - Python 3.8+ with required dependencies

            - Examples: "alert", "notification", "error"

        fexact (bool, optional): Enable exact topic name matching:
            - When True, requires precise topic name matches
            - When False, performs substring matching
