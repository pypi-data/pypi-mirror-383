def days_between_dates(fdate1: datetime, fdays_since: int):
    """
    Calculate time difference between drift detection timestamp and current time for compliance evaluation.

    Performs comprehensive date arithmetic to determine whether CloudFormation StackSet drift detection
    timestamps meet organizational compliance policies and time-based refresh requirements. Designed
    for enterprise governance automation with timezone-aware date calculations and structured result
    formatting for integration with automated compliance workflows.

    Args:
        fdate1 (datetime): Drift detection timestamp from CloudFormation StackSet metadata
                          None indicates drift detection has never been executed
                          Must be timezone-aware datetime object for accurate calculations
        fdays_since (int): Maximum acceptable age in days for drift detection compliance
                          Organizational policy threshold for drift detection refresh requirements

    Returns:
        dict: Comprehensive drift detection age evaluation containing:
            - Current: Boolean indicating compliance with organizational time policies
            - NumberOfDays: Integer days since last drift detection for operational metrics
            - ErrorMessage: Detailed error information for null or invalid timestamps

    Compliance Policy Evaluation:
        - Current=True: Drift detection age within acceptable organizational thresholds
        - Current=False: Drift detection exceeds policy limits and requires refresh
        - ErrorMessage: Indicates drift detection has never been executed (requires enablement)

    Enterprise Features:
        - Timezone-aware date calculations for accurate multi-region compliance evaluation
        - Structured result format for integration with enterprise governance systems
        - Comprehensive error handling for missing or invalid drift detection metadata
        - Policy-driven compliance evaluation with configurable time thresholds

    Date Calculation Logic:
        1. Validate drift detection timestamp existence and format
        2. Calculate absolute time difference between current time and drift detection timestamp
        3. Extract days component from timedelta for policy evaluation
        4. Compare against organizational policy threshold for compliance determination
        5. Return structured compliance result with operational metrics

    Error Handling:
        - Null timestamp handling for StackSets without drift detection history
        - Type validation ensuring datetime objects for accurate calculations
        - Timezone handling for consistent multi-region drift detection evaluation
        - Comprehensive error messaging for troubleshooting and operational visibility

    Integration Considerations:
        - Structured result format for automated compliance reporting systems
        - Policy threshold configurability for organizational governance flexibility
        - Operational metrics inclusion for drift detection age tracking and analysis
        - Error state handling for StackSets requiring initial drift detection enablement
