AWS GuardDuty Detector Discovery and Management Script

This script provides comprehensive discovery, inventory, and management capabilities for
AWS GuardDuty detectors and invitations across multiple accounts and regions. It's designed
for enterprise security teams who need visibility into GuardDuty deployment status,
detector configuration, and administrative relationships across large-scale AWS environments.

Key Features:
- Multi-account GuardDuty detector discovery using assume role capabilities
- Multi-region scanning with GuardDuty-enabled region targeting
- GuardDuty invitation tracking and management for organizational security
- Administrative account detection with member account relationship mapping
- Detector deletion capabilities with safety controls for cleanup operations
- Enterprise reporting with detailed detector and invitation analysis
- Profile-based authentication with support for federated access

Enterprise Use Cases:
- Security posture assessment and GuardDuty deployment validation
- GuardDuty administrative relationship mapping across organizations
- Security service cleanup and consolidation during account transitions
- Compliance reporting for threat detection service coverage
- Multi-account security governance and standardization
- GuardDuty cost optimization through detector lifecycle management
- Security incident response planning with detector coverage analysis

GuardDuty Management Features:
- Detector enumeration with administrative status identification
- Member account relationship tracking for security hierarchy mapping
- Invitation discovery and cleanup for organizational security management
- Multi-region detector coverage analysis for comprehensive protection
- Administrative account detection with member count reporting
- Detector deletion with safety controls and confirmation mechanisms

Security Considerations:
- Uses IAM assume role capabilities for cross-account GuardDuty access
- Implements proper error handling for authorization failures
- Supports both read-only discovery and controlled deletion operations
- Respects GuardDuty service permissions and regional availability constraints
- Provides comprehensive audit trail through detailed logging
- Implements safety controls for destructive operations with confirmation prompts

GuardDuty Administrative Analysis:
- Administrative account identification and member relationship mapping
- Invitation status tracking for organizational security coordination
- Detector configuration analysis across organizational boundaries
- Security service coverage assessment for compliance validation
- Multi-account threat detection architecture documentation

Deletion and Cleanup Features:
- Safe detector deletion with confirmation mechanisms
- Invitation cleanup for organizational security management
- Member disassociation handling for administrative relationship changes
- Comprehensive error handling for cleanup operation failures
- Audit logging for all deletion and modification operations

Performance Considerations:
- Sequential processing for reliable GuardDuty API operations
- Progress tracking for operational visibility during large-scale operations
- Efficient credential management for cross-account security access
- Region-aware processing optimized for GuardDuty service availability
- Memory-optimized data structures for large security inventories

Dependencies:
- boto3/botocore for AWS GuardDuty API interactions
- Inventory_Modules for common utility functions and credential management
- ArgumentsClass for standardized CLI argument parsing
- account_class for AWS account access and session management
- colorama for enhanced output formatting

Safety and Compliance:
- Confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- Comprehensive logging for security audit trails
- Error handling for failed deletion operations
- Member account protection during administrative cleanup
- Force deletion capability with additional safety controls

Future Enhancements:
- GuardDuty finding analysis and threat intelligence integration
- Automated detector configuration compliance checking
- Integration with AWS Config for security service drift detection
- Cost analysis and optimization recommendations for GuardDuty usage
