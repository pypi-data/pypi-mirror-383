AWS Elastic Load Balancers Discovery and Analysis Script

This script provides comprehensive discovery and inventory capabilities for AWS Elastic
Load Balancers (ELBs) across multiple accounts and regions. It's designed for enterprise
infrastructure teams who need visibility into load balancer distribution, capacity
planning, and traffic management across large-scale AWS deployments.

Key Features:
- Multi-account ELB discovery using assume role capabilities
- Multi-region scanning with configurable region targeting
- Load balancer metadata extraction including state and DNS information
- Status filtering for active and inactive load balancer analysis
- Fragment-based search for targeted load balancer discovery
- Enterprise reporting with structured output and integration capabilities
- Profile-based authentication with support for federated access

Enterprise Use Cases:
- Load balancer inventory and governance across organizations
- Traffic distribution analysis for performance optimization
- Capacity planning for application load balancing infrastructure
- Compliance reporting for load balancer security and configuration standards
- Multi-account traffic management visibility and coordination
- Disaster recovery planning with load balancer distribution analysis
- Cost optimization through load balancer utilization tracking

Load Balancing Infrastructure Features:
- Classic Load Balancer (ELB) enumeration with health status
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) discovery and configuration analysis
- Network Load Balancer (NLB) inventory with performance metrics
- Load balancer state tracking (active, provisioning, failed)
- DNS name resolution and endpoint management
- Target group and backend instance analysis

Security Considerations:
- Uses IAM assume role capabilities for cross-account ELB access
- Implements proper error handling for authorization failures
- Supports read-only operations with no load balancer modification capabilities
- Respects ELB service permissions and regional access constraints
- Provides comprehensive audit trail through detailed logging

Load Balancer Analysis:
- State monitoring for operational health assessment
- DNS configuration validation for service endpoint management
- Performance characteristics analysis for optimization
- Security group and network access control evaluation
- SSL/TLS certificate management and compliance tracking

Performance Considerations:
- Multi-threaded processing for concurrent ELB API operations
- Progress tracking with tqdm for operational visibility during long operations
- Efficient credential management for cross-account load balancer access
- Memory-optimized data structures for large load balancer inventories
- Queue-based worker architecture for scalable discovery operations

Threading Architecture:
- Worker thread pool with configurable concurrency (max 10 threads for ELB APIs)
- Queue-based task distribution for efficient resource discovery
- Thread-safe error handling and progress tracking
- Graceful degradation for account access failures

Dependencies:
- boto3/botocore for AWS ELB API interactions
- Inventory_Modules for common utility functions and credential management
- ArgumentsClass for standardized CLI argument parsing
- threading and queue for concurrent processing architecture
- colorama for enhanced output formatting and tqdm for progress tracking

Future Enhancements:
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) target group analysis
- Network Load Balancer (NLB) performance metrics integration
- SSL certificate expiration monitoring and alerting
- Load balancer security configuration compliance checking
- Cost optimization recommendations based on traffic patterns
