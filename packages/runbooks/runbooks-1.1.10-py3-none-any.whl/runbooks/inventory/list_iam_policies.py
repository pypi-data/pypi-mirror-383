AWS IAM Policies Discovery and Action Analysis Script

This script provides comprehensive discovery and analysis capabilities for AWS Identity
and Access Management (IAM) policies across multiple accounts and regions. It's designed
for enterprise security and compliance teams who need visibility into policy distribution,
permission analysis, and action-specific security assessment across large-scale AWS deployments.

Key Features:
- Multi-account IAM policy discovery using assume role capabilities
- Policy action analysis for permission tracking and security assessment
- Customer-managed policy filtering for organizational policy governance
- Fragment-based search for targeted policy discovery and analysis
- Enterprise reporting with CSV export and structured output
- Profile-based authentication with support for federated access

Enterprise Use Cases:
- Security policy audit and compliance reporting across organizations
- Permission analysis for least privilege access implementation
- Policy governance and standardization across organizational boundaries
- Security incident response with policy and permission analysis
- Compliance reporting for access control and authorization standards
- Multi-account IAM governance and policy lifecycle management
- Risk assessment through policy action enumeration and analysis

IAM Policy Analysis Features:
- Comprehensive policy enumeration with metadata extraction
- Policy action discovery for permission tracking and analysis
- Customer-managed policy identification for organizational governance
- Cross-account policy consistency analysis and standardization
- Policy fragment search for targeted security assessment
- Permission correlation across organizational boundaries

Security Considerations:
- Uses IAM assume role capabilities for cross-account policy access
- Implements proper error handling for authorization failures
- Supports read-only operations with no policy modification capabilities
- Respects IAM service permissions and regional access constraints
- Provides comprehensive audit trail through detailed logging
- Sensitive permission information handling with appropriate access controls

Policy Governance Features:
- Customer-managed policy filtering for organizational policy oversight
- Policy action enumeration for security and compliance analysis
- Cross-account policy visibility for governance and standardization
- Fragment-based search for targeted policy discovery and assessment
- Policy lifecycle tracking for governance and compliance management

Performance Considerations:
- Multi-threaded processing for concurrent IAM API operations
- Progress tracking for operational visibility during large-scale operations
- Efficient credential management for cross-account policy access
- Memory-optimized data structures for large policy inventories
- Queue-based worker architecture for scalable policy discovery

Threading Architecture:
- Worker thread pool with configurable concurrency for policy action analysis
- Queue-based task distribution for efficient policy processing
- Thread-safe error handling and progress tracking
- Graceful degradation for account access failures

Dependencies:
- boto3/botocore for AWS IAM API interactions
- Inventory_Modules for common utility functions and credential management
- ArgumentsClass for standardized CLI argument parsing
- threading and queue for concurrent processing architecture
- colorama for enhanced output formatting

Compliance and Audit Features:
- Comprehensive policy discovery for security auditing
- Action-specific permission analysis for compliance validation
- Cross-account policy governance for organizational security
- Customer-managed policy tracking for organizational oversight
- Fragment-based search for targeted compliance assessment

Future Enhancements:
- Policy risk assessment with privilege escalation detection
- Automated policy compliance checking against security standards
- Integration with AWS Config for policy configuration drift detection
- Policy optimization recommendations for least privilege implementation
