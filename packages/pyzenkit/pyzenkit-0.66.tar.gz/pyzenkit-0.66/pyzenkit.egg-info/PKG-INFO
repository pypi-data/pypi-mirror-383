This package contains collection of usefull tools and utilities and framework
for creating console applications, scripts and system services (daemons) in
Python 3. It provides easily extendable and customizable base implementations
of generic application, script or daemon and which take care of many common
issues and tasks like configuration loading and merging, command line argument
parsing, logging setup, etc.

The extensive documentation and tutorials is still under development, however
usage examples and demonstration applications are provided right in the source
code of appropriate module. Just execute the module with Python3 interpretter
to see the demonstration::

    python3 path/to/application.py --help

Currently the framework package contains following features:

``pyzenkit.jsonconf``
    Module for handling JSON based configuration files and directories.

``pyzenkit.daemonizer``
