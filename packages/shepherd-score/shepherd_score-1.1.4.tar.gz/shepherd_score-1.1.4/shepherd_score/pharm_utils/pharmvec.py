    Get the direction vectors for Acceptor of type 1.

    This is a acceptor with one heavy atom neighbor. There are two possibilities we will
    consider here
    1. The bond to the heavy atom is a single bond e.g. CO
     In this case we don't know the exact direction and we just use the inversion of this bond direction
     and mark this direction as a 'cone'
    2. The bond to the heavy atom is a double bond e.g. C=O
     In this case the we have two possible direction except in some special cases e.g. SO2
