chunk_extractor_prompt = PromptTemplate(

You are a chunk extractor. Your task is to identify and extract relevant text chunks from a document that are related to a specific query.

Given the following text, extract the most relevant chunks of text that directly answer or relate to the user query.

Text:
{text}

Instructions:
1. Identify text chunks that are directly relevant to the query
2. Each chunk should be a coherent piece of text (sentences or paragraphs)
3. Extract the exact text verbatim from the input - do not paraphrase or modify
4. Include position information (page number, section, or paragraph number if available)
5. Return results as a JSON array with the format:
   [{{\"relevant_chunk_text\": \"exact text from input\", \"position_in_document\": \"page/section identifier\"}}]

Please be flexible in finding relevant information, as it may not always be in a single contiguous section.
The relevant information may be spread across different parts of the text.
Use the largest chunks possible that still maintain coherence.

The page/section identifier can be a page number, section title, or paragraph number specifically related to the text chunk (these coordinates should help locate the chunk in the original document).

If no relevant chunks are found, return an empty array [].
Only return the JSON array, no other text.
