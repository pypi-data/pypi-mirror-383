# CouchDB Client
A very simple [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org) Python client.

## Installation
`pip install couchdb-client`

## Usage
See [example.py](https://github.com/EnzoPB/couchdb-client/blob/master/src/example.py)

## Notes
This is a library I made because the [IBM Cloudant SDK](https://github.com/IBM/cloudant-python-sdk) was to complex for what I needed.
This library does not have a lot of features, but I tried to keep its code very basic, so anyone can add a feature.
