Given the evaluation steps, return a JSON with two keys:
1) a `score` key ranging from 0 - 10, with 10 being that it follows the criteria outlined in the steps and 0 being that it does not.
2) a `reason` key, a reason for the given score. Please mention specific information from {{ evaluation_params }} in your reason, but be very concise with it!
