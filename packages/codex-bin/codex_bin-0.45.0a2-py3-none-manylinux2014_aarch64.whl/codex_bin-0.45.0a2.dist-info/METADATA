# codex-bin

This project is part of the [pybin family of packages](https://github.com/justin-yan/pybin/tree/main/src/pybin), which are generally permissively-licensed binary tools that have been re-packaged to be distributable via python's PyPI infrastructure using `pip install $TOOLNAME-bin`.

This is *not* affiliated with the upstream project found at https://github.com/openai/codex, and is merely a repackaging of their releases for installation through PyPI.  If the upstream project wants to officially release their tool on PyPI, please just reach out and we will happily transfer the project ownership over.

We attempt to reflect the license of the upstream tool on the releases in PyPI, but double-check at the upstream before use.

## Packaging Details

This project was inspired by how [Maturin packages rust binaries](https://www.maturin.rs/bindings#bin).  The key observation is that in the wheel format, the [distribution-1.0.data/scripts/ directory is copied to bin](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#installing-a-wheel-distribution-1-0-py32-none-any-whl), which means we can leverage this to seamlessly copy binaries onto a user's PATH.  Combined with Python's platform-specific wheels, this allows us to somehwat use pip as a "cross-platform package manager" for distributing single-binary CLI applications.
