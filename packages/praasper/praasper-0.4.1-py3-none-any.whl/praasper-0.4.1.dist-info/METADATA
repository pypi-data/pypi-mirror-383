**Praasper** is an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) framework designed to help researchers transribe audio files to **utterance-level** text with accurate transcriptoin and timestamps.

![mechanism](promote/mechanism.png)

In **Praasper**, we adopt a rather simple and straightforward pipeline to extract utterance-level information from audio files. The pipeline includes [SenseVoiceSmall](https://github.com/modelscope/funasr) and [Praditor](https://github.com/Paradeluxe/Praditor). 


For more information about supported languages, please refer to the [FunASR](https://github.com/modelscope/funasr) repository.




# How to use

The default model is `iic/SenseVoiceSmall`.

>I personally recommend to use the SOTA model as time isn't a really big problem for offline processing.

Here is a **simplest** example:

```python
import praasper

model = praasper.init_model()
model.annote(input_path="data")  # The folder where you store .wav
```

Here are all the parameters you can pass to the `annote` method:

```python
model.annote(
    input_path="data",
    language=None,  # "zh" for Mandarin, "yue" for Cantonese, "en" for English, None for automatic language detection
    seg_dur=15.,  # Segment large audio into pieces, 15 seconds as default.
)
```


# Mechanism

**Praditor** is applied to perform **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** algorithm to trim the currently existing word/character-level timestamps to **millisecond level**. It is a Speech Onset Detection (SOT) algorithm we developed for langauge researchers.

**SenseVoiceSmall** is used to transcribe the audio file, which does not offer timestamps. It has better support for short-length audio files, compared to *Whisper*.



# Setup
## pip installation

```bash
pip install -U praasper
```
> If you have a succesful installation and don't care if there is GPU accelaration, you can stop it right here.


## GPU Acceleration (Windows/Linux)
`Whisper` can automaticly detects the best currently available device to use. But you still need to first install GPU-support version `torch` in order to enable CUDA acceleration.

- For **macOS** users, `Whisper` only supports `CPU` as the processing device.
- For **Windows/Linux** users, the priority order should be: `CUDA` -> `CPU`.

If you have no experience in installing `CUDA`, follow the steps below:



**First**, go to command line and check the latest CUDA version your system supports:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

Results should pop up like this (It means that this device supports CUDA up to version 12.9).

```bash
| NVIDIA-SMI 576.80                 Driver Version: 576.80         CUDA Version: 12.9     |
```

**Next**, go to [**NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit**](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and download the latest version, or whichever version that fits your system/need.

**Lastly**, install `torch` that fits your CUDA version. Find the correct `pip` command [**in this link**](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Here is an example for CUDA 12.9:

```bash
pip install --reinstall torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu129
```


## (Advanced) uv installation
`uv` is also highly recommended for way **FASTER** installation. First, make sure `uv` is installed to your default environment:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Then, create a virtual environment (e.g., .venv):

```bash
uv venv .venv
```

You should see a new `.venv` folder pops up in your project folder now. (You might also want to restart the terminal.)

Lastly, install `praasper` (by adding `uv` before `pip`):


```bash
uv pip install -U praasper
```
For `CUDA` support,

```bash
uv pip install --reinstall torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu129
# Or whichever version that matches your CUDA version
```
