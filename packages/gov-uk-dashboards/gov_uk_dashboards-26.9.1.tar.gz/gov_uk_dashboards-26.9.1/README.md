    y_column = "Value",
    category_column = "Category"
)

line_chart = figures.line_chart(
    data = chart_data,
    title = "Chart title"
    line_style = {
        "Category 1": figures.format.LineFormat(
            color = "#000000",
            dash_pattern = figures.enums.DashPatterns.SOLID,
        ),
    }
)
```
## Updating the CSS

We use SCSS to generate our CSS - NEVER directly alter the `dashboard.css` file in the assets folder.
To update CSS:
- Add your changes to `dashboard.scss` in the sccs folder
- Run `npm install` if you haven't recently (/ever)
- Run `npm run sass` to generate CSS from SCSS
- Change package version in setup.py
- Push your changes to a new branch 
- Try new CSS on dashboard repo using pip install git+https://github.com/communitiesuk/pkg_gov_uk_dashboards.git@<YOUR-BRANCH-NAME>

## Updating govuk-frontend CSS
- Update govuk-frontend version in package.json 
- Run `npm run sass` to generate CSS from SCSS
- Follow steps above to test new CSS on dashboard repo


## Updating the package

When making changes to the package, the following should be done:

- Update version in setup.py accordingly
    - Style: Major.Minor.Patch, e.g. 1.2.3
    - Major - any breaking changes to previous functionality.
    - Minor - additional functionality that doesn't effect backward compatibility. When updated the patch version should be reset to zero. eg. 2.3.1 goes to 2.4.0 for minor update.
    - Patch - bug fixes that don't effect backward compatibility.
    For more information see [here](https://semver.org)
- After merging with main, go [here](https://github.com/communitiesuk/pkg_gov_uk_dashboards/releases) to add a new version tag.
    - Click 'Draft a new release'
    - Under 'Choose a tag' dropdown, enter 'v&lt;version number&gt;'. Click 'Create new tag'
    - Give the tag a release title, this should be the same as the tag name.
    - Give a bullet point list of changes in the "Describe this release" section.
    - Make sure 'Target' is set to 'main'.
    - Click 'Publish release'.
    - The release will be [uploaded to PyPI.org automatically][pypi-workflow].
- Update the package references within projects where the package is used, by following the [Installation](#Install) section.

## Trying out changes to the package from other repositories

When you want to make changes to the package to use in another repository, it can be useful to see what changes would look like before commiting to the package repo. You can do this by making changes directly to the package files in the conda environment of the repository you're working in.

- Open the file you wish to change in the conda environment
- Do this by clicking into functions from the package in your IDE or by finding the file you wish to change in your file system, e.g.
 ```.../anaconda3/envs/*repo*/lib/python3.9/site-packages/gov_uk_dashboards/components/...```
- Make the changes to the package file and you should see the changes in your localhost on refresh
- If you want to undo your changes: `pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall <package_name>~=<package_version>`

When you're happy, you can make the changes on a branch in the package repo and install it locally to check it works as expected when imported before merging into main in the package repo:
- You can update the *environment.yml* to point at your branch or run ```pip install``` with the url:
    ```git+https://github.com/communitiesuk/pkg_gov_uk_dashboards.git@<your-branch>```
