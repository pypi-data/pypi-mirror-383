# ScrubPy - Enhanced Smart Data Cleaning Assistant

An intelligent, conversation-driven data cleaning and analysis tool that combines automated insights with LLM-powered assistance.

## 🚀 New Features & Improvements

### 🤖 **Interactive Dataset Chat**
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions about your data in plain English
- **Smart Context Awareness**: AI understands your dataset structure and provides relevant insights
- **Quick Commands**: Built-in shortcuts for common analysis tasks
- **Session Persistence**: Save and resume conversations

```bash
# Start a chat session with your dataset
python -m scrubpy.enhanced_cli chat data.csv

# Example queries:
# "What are the main data quality issues?"
# "Show me outliers in the price column"
# "Suggest cleaning steps for this dataset"
```

### 🔍 **Advanced Data Quality Analysis**
- **Comprehensive Scoring**: 100-point quality score with detailed breakdown
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies missing data patterns, business rule violations
- **Smart Recommendations**: Prioritized suggestions based on impact and effort
- **Automated Reports**: JSON, YAML, and text export formats

```bash
# Run quality analysis
python -m scrubpy.enhanced_cli analyze data.csv --format json
```

### ⚡ **Quick Clean Mode**
- **One-Command Cleaning**: Apply sensible defaults for common issues
- **Intelligent Type Detection**: Auto-convert numeric strings, dates
- **Batch Processing**: Clean multiple files simultaneously
- **Smart Defaults**: Handles duplicates, missing values, outliers automatically

```bash
# Quick clean with smart defaults
python -m scrubpy.enhanced_cli quick-clean data.csv --ops duplicates missing types

# Batch process multiple files
python -m scrubpy.enhanced_cli batch ./data/ --ops analyze insights
```

### 🧠 **Enhanced Column Intelligence**
- **Role Detection**: Automatically identifies column purposes (ID, categorical, monetary, etc.)
- **Business Rule Validation**: Detects invalid emails, ages, percentages
- **Transformation Suggestions**: Smart recommendations for each column type
- **Confidence Scoring**: Reliability metrics for all insights

### 🛠️ **Improved CLI Experience**
- **Multiple Entry Points**: Choose between full interactive mode or specific commands
- **Configuration Management**: Persistent settings for LLM models, output formats
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback for long-running operations
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of common issues

### 🤝 **Smart Imputation Engine**
- **Multiple Strategies**: KNN, Iterative (MICE), ML-based prediction
- **Pattern-Aware**: Considers missing data patterns when choosing methods
- **Correlation-Based**: Uses relationships between columns for better imputation
- **Validation**: Business rule compliance for imputed values
