## Using TUNA

### Prerequisites
The program requires Python 3.12 or higher and the following packages:

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* termcolor

### Installation

The simplest way to install TUNA and its dependencies is by running

```
pip install QuantumTUNA
```

Find the path to where TUNA is installed, `*/TUNA/`, with the other Python site packages.

On Windows, add this folder to PATH by editing the system environment variables.


On MacOS and Linux, find this folder's path and from a terminal, run

```
echo "alias tuna='noglob python3 /*/TUNA/tuna.py'" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "alias TUNA='noglob python3 /*/TUNA/tuna.py'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Then, in a new terminal, run ```TUNA --version``` which should print the correct version if TUNA has installed correctly.

### Running

The syntax of the command to run a TUNA calculation is

```
TUNA [Calculation] : [Atom A] [Atom B] [Distance] : [Method] [Basis]
```
