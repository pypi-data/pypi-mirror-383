# meow

**meow** is a terminal markdown viewer written in python and inspired by [glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow). it's just a `cat` with [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich), though, no file browsing! (yet?)

## features

- uses `LS_COLORS` â€” respects your terminal colorscheme for all you (us) ricers
- syntax highlighting in fenced codeblocks via Pygments
- styled lists, headers, blockquotes, and **bold** and *italics*
- `git log`-like, terminal height-aware paging

### gripes / future

- [ ] make the checkboxes cuter! glow-style `[ ]` / `[-]` / `[x]`
- [ ] tables...
