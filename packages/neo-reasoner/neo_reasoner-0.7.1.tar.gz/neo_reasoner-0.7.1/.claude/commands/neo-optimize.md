description: Get optimization suggestions from Neo
argument-hint: [file-path or function-name]
---

Use the Neo agent to analyze and suggest optimizations for:

Target: $ARGUMENTS

Focus areas:
- Algorithmic complexity improvements (time and space)
- Performance bottlenecks
- Resource utilization
- Scalability concerns

Ask Neo to consider the current implementation and suggest 10x leverage improvements based on its semantic memory of similar optimizations.
