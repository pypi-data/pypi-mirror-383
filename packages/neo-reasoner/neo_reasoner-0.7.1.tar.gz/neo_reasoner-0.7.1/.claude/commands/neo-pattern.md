description: Extract reusable patterns with Neo
argument-hint: [code-area or pattern-type]

Use the Neo agent to identify and extract reusable patterns from:

Target: $ARGUMENTS

Ask Neo to:
1. Identify common patterns and archetypes
2. Suggest abstractions or generalizations
3. Provide confidence scores for pattern applicability
4. Check semantic memory for similar successful patterns
5. Recommend when to use vs. not use the pattern

This helps build a pattern library and avoid reinventing solutions.
