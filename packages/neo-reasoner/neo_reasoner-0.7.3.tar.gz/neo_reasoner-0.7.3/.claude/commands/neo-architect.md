description: Get architectural guidance from Neo on design decisions
argument-hint: [your architectural question]
---

Use the Neo agent to provide architectural guidance using its multi-agent reasoning system and semantic memory:

Question: $ARGUMENTS

Ask Neo to:
1. Analyze tradeoffs between different approaches
2. Provide confidence scores for each recommendation
3. Reference similar patterns from its memory
4. Consider long-term maintainability and scalability
5. Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies

Request Neo to think through this using its Solver, Critic, and Verifier agents for thorough analysis.
