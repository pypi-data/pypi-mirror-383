Contribute to Rally
===================

For general information on contributing to OpenStack, please check out the
`contributor guide <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/>`_ to get started.
It covers all the basics that are common to all OpenStack projects:
the accounts you need, the basics of interacting with our Gerrit review system,
how we communicate as a community, etc.
Below will cover the more project specific information you need to get started
with Rally.

Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Gitter channel https://gitter.im/xRally/Lobby
* IRC channel #openstack-rally at OFTC
* Mailing list (prefix subjects with ``[rally]`` for faster responses)
  http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-discuss

Contacting the Core Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please refer the `Rally Core Team
<https://review.opendev.org/admin/groups/b809b67b705ecb181cef2e1e68e06cac5c61882b>`_
contacts.

Task Tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We track our tasks in `Launchpad <https://bugs.launchpad.net/rally>`_.
If you're looking for some smaller, easier work item to pick up and get started
on, search for the 'low-hanging-fruit' tag.

Reporting a Bug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You found an issue and want to make sure we are aware of it? You can do so on
`Launchpad <https://bugs.launchpad.net/rally>`_.

Getting Your Patch Merged
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All changes proposed to the Rally project require one or two +2 votes
from Rally core reviewers before one of the core reviewers can approve
patch by giving ``Workflow +1`` vote.

Project Team Lead Duties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All common PTL duties are enumerated in the `PTL guide
<https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/ptl.html>`_.
