# *DIRESA-Torch*


### Overview

*DIRESA-Torch* is a Python package for dimension reduction based on 
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). The distance-regularized 
Siamese twin autoencoder architecture is designed to preserve distance 
(ordering) in latent space while capturing the non-linearities in
the datasets.
