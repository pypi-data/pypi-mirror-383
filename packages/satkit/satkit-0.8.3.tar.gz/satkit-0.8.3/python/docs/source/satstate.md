# SatState

the ``satstate`` class is a convenience class for using the [high-precision orbit propagator](satprop-doc) to propagate positions and velocities.  The class maintains the satellite state: position, velocity, time, and possibly covariance, and includes internal functionality for propagating that state to a new time.
