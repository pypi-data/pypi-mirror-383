This tool provides advanced coding capabilities using the new OpenAI reasoning models. By installing this package with `pip install jprcfai`, you will greatly benefit from faster code development performance.

For more advanced premium tools:
- Automatic deployment using CLI tools for AWS and other platforms.
- Parallel reasoning and final checkpoint evaluation for better results.
- Prompt engineering agents! While there are tools to help with your tasks, they are usually not very flexible. To increase flexibility, we need an automation tool that creates inner automation to execute your task. The objective is to move from the old approach of `AItool -> Task` to `AItool -> AItool -> Task`. This way, we can have a more flexible and powerful tool that can be used for many different tasks and is actually faster in most situations.
