## PIP
Installation is as simple as:
```shell
pip install driconfig
```
DriConfig heavily depends on two other Python libraries,
that will be installed as dependencies:

* [**Pydantic**](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) is a _data validation framework using Python type annotations._
* [**PyYAML**](https://pyyaml.org/) is _a full-featured YAML framework for the Python programming language._
