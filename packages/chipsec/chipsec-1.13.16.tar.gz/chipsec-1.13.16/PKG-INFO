CHIPSEC: Platform Security Assessment Framework
===============================================

CHIPSEC is a framework for analyzing the security of PC platforms including hardware, system firmware (BIOS/UEFI), and platform components. It includes a security test suite, tools for accessing various low level interfaces, and forensic capabilities. It can be run on Windows, Linux, and UEFI shell. Instructions for installing and using CHIPSEC can be found in the [manual](chipsec-manual.pdf).

NOTE: This software is for security testing purposes. Use at your own risk. Read WARNING.txt before using.

First version of CHIPSEC was released in March 2014:
