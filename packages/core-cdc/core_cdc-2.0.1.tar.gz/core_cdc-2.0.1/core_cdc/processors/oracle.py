    Oracle Database does not provide a dedicated Python library similar to
    the SQL Server Change Data Capture (CDC) feature. However, you can implement change
    data capture in Oracle using a combination of Oracle features and Oracle Database
    connectors for Python.

    Here's a general approach:

    1. **Oracle Flashback Technology:**
       - Oracle offers Flashback Technology, including Flashback Query and Flashback Version Query, which allows you to query data as it appeared at a previous point in time.
       - You can leverage these features to implement a form of change data capture by periodically querying the database for changes within a specified time range.

    2. **Database Triggers:**
       - Oracle supports triggers, which are procedures that are automatically executed in response to specific events on a particular table or view.
       - You can create triggers to capture information about changes (e.g., inserts, updates, deletes) into separate audit or change tables.

    3. **LogMiner:**
       - Oracle LogMiner is a utility that allows you to mine redo log files and obtain information about changes made to the database.
       - You can use Oracle's LogMiner to track changes and update a change tracking table.

    4. **Oracle Database Connectors for Python:**
       - You can use Python libraries such as `cx_Oracle` to connect to Oracle Database and execute queries or procedures that implement your change data capture logic.
       - Install `cx_Oracle` using: `pip install cx_Oracle`.

    Here's a simplified example using Python and `cx_Oracle`:

    Example::

        import cx_Oracle

        # Connect to Oracle
        connection = cx_Oracle.connect("username/password@localhost/orcl")

        # Create a cursor
        cursor = connection.cursor()

        # Execute a query using Flashback Query
        query = "SELECT * FROM your_table AS OF TIMESTAMP (SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' DAY)"
        cursor.execute(query)

        # Fetch the results
        for row in cursor.fetchall():
            print(row)

        # Close the cursor and connection
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()

    Remember that Oracle Database may have specific requirements and considerations
    for implementing change data capture based on your use case. You might also want to
    explore Oracle GoldenGate, a comprehensive solution for real-time data integration
    and replication that goes beyond basic change tracking.
