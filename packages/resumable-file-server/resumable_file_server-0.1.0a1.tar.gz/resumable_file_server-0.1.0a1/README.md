# Resumable File Server

A simple, multithreaded HTTP file server supporting resumable downloads and file uploads written in pure Python. Drop-in replacement for `SimpleHTTPServer`, `http.server`.

## Features

- Supports Python 2 and Python 3
- Proper handling of Unicode
- Support for HTTP Range requests (partial downloads)
- Multithreaded serving (handles many clients)
- Directory browsing and file upload via UTF-8 HTML interface
- Specify root directory to serve files from
- Configurable host/IP and port

## Usage

Serve files inside `/home/user` on `localhost:8080`:

```bash
python -m resumable_file_server 8080 --host localhost --port  --root /home/user/
```

Then download with `curl`:

```bash
curl -O -C - http://localhost:8080/largefile.zip
```

You can also upload a file (this uploads it to `/home/user/images/`):

```
curl -X POST -F "file=@/path/to/photo.jpg" http://localhost:8080/images/
```

And you will see an UTF-8 HTML with a file picker and upload button at the bottom if you open `http://localhost:8080/` with your browser.
