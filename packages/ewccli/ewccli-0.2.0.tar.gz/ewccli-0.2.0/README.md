## Prerequisites

- You will need a python environment to run the library implementation of this code. Python version **3.11** or higher.
- **git** installed on your operating system. (usually is available to most OS nowadays)

### Openstack inputs

## Installing

We recommend installing **ewccli** inside a **virtual environment** to avoid dependency conflicts with system packages.

### Installing with PIP from PyPI

The EWC CLI Python package is available through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

```bash
pip install ewccli
```

### Installing from source

1. Fork this repository and move into it
```bash
git clone THIS_REPO && cd ewccli
```

2. Create virtualenv with minimum python version > 3.10

```bash
python3 -m venv ewcclienv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source ./ewcclienv/bin/activate
```

4. Upgrade pip

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

5. Install the package

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Getting started

Then run `ewc` to verify everything works:

![ewccli-default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewcloud/ewccli/main/images/ewccli-default.png)

If you get a WARNING like `WARNING: The script ewc is installed in '~/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.` Add the following to your profile configuration file:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
```

## Login to prepare the environment

```bash
ewc login
```

IMPORTANT:

- EWC CLI uses the following order of importance:
    - env variables
    - cli config
    - any other config (e.g. Openstack cloud.yaml or Kubernetes `kubeconfig` file)

## List items

The following command shows the current available items. Official items are listed [here](https://github.com/ewcloud/ewc-community-hub/blob/main/items.yaml).

```bash
ewc hub list
```
![ewccli-hub-list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewcloud/ewccli/main/images/ewccli-hub-list.png)


## Deploy an item

![ewccli-hub-deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewcloud/ewccli/main/images/ewccli-hub-deploy.png)

```bash
ewc hub deploy ITEM
```
where ITEM is taken from `ewc hub list` command under Item column.

## Backends
