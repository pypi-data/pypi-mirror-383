# MaLaC Utils

MaLaC-HD (MApping LAnguage Compiler for Health Data) is a tool that you can use to convert mappings between different health data formats to executable code. It can also be used as a library to dynamically execute mappings.

This is the utils package to execute generated mappings. You can use it independently from the `malac-hd` package, together with the appropriate model packages.
