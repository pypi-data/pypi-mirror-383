description: Create an implementation plan using the implementation-planner agent
---

I'll help you create an implementation plan. First, please provide a brief description to seed the planning process. You can:

- Describe a feature you want to implement
- Paste an error message you want to fix
- Share output from a tool
- Describe a refactoring or optimization goal
- Copy/paste any relevant context

**What would you like to plan?**

(Once you provide the information, I'll use the implementation-planner agent to create a detailed, iterative plan that we can refine together. After we finalize the plan, I will automatically save it to a markdown file at the root of the repository with a descriptive filename based on the feature being planned.)
