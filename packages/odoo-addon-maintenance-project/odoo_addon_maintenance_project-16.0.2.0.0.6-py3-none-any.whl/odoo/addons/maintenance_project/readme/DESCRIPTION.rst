This module extends the functionality of Odoo Maintenance module adding this features:

- Adds a project to an equipment. You can link an existing project or create a new one (with the Create project button) after creating the equipment.
- Adds project and task to a maintenance request. The default project for a request will be the equipment one, including the preventive requests periodically created.

This is is a technical addon to allow timesheet assignment to a maintenance request.
