  design_requirements:
  - The underscore diacritic (U+0331 COMBINING MACRON BELOW) should be aligned on the center vertical axis of the base glyph (offset in italic type). It is narrower than the width of the base glyph. It does not connect to preceding or following glyphs, unlike U+0332 COMBINING LOW LINE.
  - The underscore diacritic (U+0331) for lowercase <g̱> may either cross the descender of <g> below the baseline or appear entirely below the descender of <g>. It should never intersect the bowl of <g>. Positioning below the descender is more common but may cause it to become invisible if interline spacing (leading) is small or zero.
  - The period (U+002E FULL STOP) is used both as a letter and as punctuation. As a letter it indicates glottal stop /ʔ/ and occurs either at the beginning or in the middle of an orthographic word. As punctuation it appears only at the end of an orthographic word. Spacing and kerning should be sensitive to these different contexts. Vertical position is the same in both contexts.
  - The letter apostrophe <ʼ> distinguishes ejective sounds like /tʼ/ <tʼ> from non-ejective sounds like /tʰ/ <t> and is not punctuation. It should be represented by U+02BC MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE which is specified by Unicode as a letter (character class Lm). It is sometimes instead represented by <'> U+0027 APOSTROPHE or <’> U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK but these should be reserved for punctuation (Unicode character classes Po and Pi). Some fonts kern or vertically position U+02BC differently from U+2019 to distinguish them in text, and some fonts use slightly different shapes.

  note: This is the Revised Popular or ‘underscore’ orthography, sometimes known as the ‘Coastal’ orthography. Uvular consonants have an underscore diacritic where velar consonants do not, /χ/ <x̱> vs. /x/ <x>. Short vowels are written with one glyph /i/ <i>, /e/ <e>, /a/ <a>, /u/ <u>. Long vowels are written with two glyphs, /iː/ <ee>, /eː/ <ei>, /aː/ <aa>, /uː/ <oo>. High tone is indicated by an acute diacritic as in /é/ <é> and /éː/ <éi> and low tone is not marked.

  - The ogonek diacritic (U+0328 COMBINING OGONEK) is used for nasalized vowels (compare e.g. Navajo) and may be combined with any of the acute, grave, or circumflex diacritics on a single vowel character. Combinations may be in either the order base + ogonek + diacritic or the order base + diacritic + ogonek. Positioning of the ogonek generally follows the practice for European languages like Polish and Lithuanian in being attached to the base character on the right for <Ą>, <ą>, <ę>, <ų> etc.

  note: This is the Leer orthography, sometimes known as the ‘YNLC’ or ‘Inland’ orthography. Uvular consonants have an additional <h> where velar consonants do not, /χ/ <xh> vs. /x/ <x>. Vowel length and tone are combined in a single diacritic, short /è/ <e> vs. /é/ <é> and long /èː/ <è> vs. /éː/ <ê>.
