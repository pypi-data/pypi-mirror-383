"""
Controllers for interacting with Reaper using reapy.

This package contains specialized controllers for different aspects of Reaper functionality:
- BaseController: Core initialization and connection handling
- TrackController: Track creation, renaming, and management
- FXController: Effects management
- MarkerController: Marker and region operations
- MIDIController: MIDI item creation and manipulation
- AudioController: Audio file insertion and media operations
- MasterController: Master track operations

The ReaperController class combines all these controllers into a single, easy-to-use class.
