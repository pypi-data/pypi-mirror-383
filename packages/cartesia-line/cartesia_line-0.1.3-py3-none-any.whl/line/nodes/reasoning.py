ReasoningNode

A base class for agent reasoning using the template method pattern.

- Handles conversation history and tool calls.
- Defines a standard flow for generating agent responses.
- Subclasses implement `process_context()` to provide custom reasoning.

This class simplifies building agents that need both conversation management and tool integration.
