description = "Pyistat is a friendly module made to easily allow anyone to use Python to search and get datasets from ISTAT APIs. There are two modules: the search module is used to find datasets and gives all the information needed to build a request URL. The get module is used to get data after helping you properly setup the dimensions (the keys, as called by ISTAT). Full documentation available on Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/Derto/pyistat"
