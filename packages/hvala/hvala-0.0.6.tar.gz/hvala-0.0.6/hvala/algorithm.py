def find_vertex_cover(graph):

    Compute a near-optimal vertex cover for an undirected graph with an approximation ratio under sqrt(2).
    
    A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident 
    to at least one vertex in the set. This function finds an approximate solution
    using a polynomial-time reduction approach.

        graph (nx.Graph): Input undirected graph.
    
    Returns:
       set: A set of vertex indices representing the approximate vertex cover set.
             Returns an empty set if the graph is empty or has no edges.
             
    Raises:
        ValueError: If input is not a NetworkX Graph object.

        This function implements a polynomial-time reduction technique:

        2. Each auxiliary vertex connects to one of u's original neighbors with weight 1/k
        3. Solve the resulting max-degree-1 problem optimally using greedy algorithms
