Boring Math - Recursive Functions
=================================

PyPI project
`boring-math-recursive-functions
<https://pypi.org/project/boring-math-recursive-functions>`_.

The purpose of this project is to explore different ways to efficiently
implement recursion in Python.

Computable recursive functions can be defined with previously defined or even
not yet defined values. Functions defined using previously well defined values
having "base cases" are called "primitively recursive functions." Not all
computable functions are primitively recursive.

This pypi project is part of the
`boring math
<https://grscheller.github.io/boring-math>`_ projects.
