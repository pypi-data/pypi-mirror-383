Entry points for automatically generated CLI scripts
----------------------------------------------------

The CGI package automatically generates Python scripts in an OS independent way
using the packaging build backend. This is configured by the `[project.scripts]`
section in the project's pyproject.toml file.

Example applications
--------------------

- Ackermann's function

  - **ackermann_list:** Calculate values for a computable but not simple
    recursive function.

- Fibonacci sequences

  - **fibonacci:** Generate Fibonacci sequences both forward and backward.
