  name: The AI Risk Taxonomy (AIR 2024)
  description: We present a comprehensive AI risk taxonomy derived from eight government
    policies from the European Union, United States, and China and 16 company policies
    worldwide, making a significant step towards establishing a unified language for
    generative AI safety evaluation. We identify 314 unique risk categories, organized
    into a four-tiered taxonomy. At the highest level, this taxonomy encompasses System
    & Operational Risks, Content Safety Risks, Societal Risks, and Legal & Rights
    Risks. The taxonomy establishes connections between various descriptions and approaches
    to risk, highlighting the overlaps and discrepancies between public and private
    sector conceptions of risk. By providing this unified framework, we aim to advance
    AI safety through information sharing across sectors and the promotion of best
    practices in risk mitigation for generative AI models and systems.
