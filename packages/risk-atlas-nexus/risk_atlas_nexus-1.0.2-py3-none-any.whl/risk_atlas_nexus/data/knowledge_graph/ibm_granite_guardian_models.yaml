  description: Granite Guardian 3.2 3B-A800M is a fine-tuned Granite 3.2 3B-A800M instruct model designed to detect risks in prompts and responses. It can help with risk detection along many key dimensions catalogued in the IBM AI Risk Atlas. It is trained on unique data comprising human annotations and synthetic data informed by internal red-teaming. It outperforms other open-source models in the same space on standard benchmarks.

    Granite Guardian 3.2 5B is a thinned down version of Granite Guardian 3.1 8B designed to detect risks in prompts
    and responses. It can help with risk detection along many key dimensions catalogued in the IBM AI Risk Atlas. To
    generate this model, the Granite Guardian is iteratively pruned and healed on the same unique data comprising human
    annotations and synthetic data informed by internal red-teaming used for its training. About 30% of the original
    parameters were removed allowing for faster inference and lower resource requirements while still providing
    competitive performance. It outperforms other open-source models in the same space on standard benchmarks.

  description:  >-
    Granite Guardian 3.3 8b is a specialized Granite 3.3 8B model designed to judge if the input prompts and the output
    responses of an LLM based system meet specified criteria. The model comes pre-baked with certain criteria including
    but not limited to: jailbreak attempts, profanity, and hallucinations related to tool calls and retrieval augmented
    generation in agent-based systems. Additionally, the model also allows users to bring their own criteria and tailor
    the judging behavior to specific use-cases.

    This version of Granite Guardian is a hybrid thinking model that allows the user to operate in thinking or
    non-thinking model. In thinking mode, the model produces detailed reasoning traces though <think> ... </think> and
    <score> ... </score> tags. In non-thinking mode, the model only produces the judgement score though the <score> ...
    </score> tags.

    It is trained on unique data comprising human annotations and synthetic data informed by internal red-teaming. It
    outperforms other open-source models in the same space on standard benchmarks.

    Granite-3.3-8B-Instruct is a 8-billion parameter 128K context length language model fine-tuned for improved
    reasoning and instruction-following capabilities. Built on top of Granite-3.3-8B-Base, the model delivers
    significant gains on benchmarks for measuring generic performance including AlpacaEval-2.0 and Arena-Hard, and
    improvements in mathematics, coding, and instruction following. It supports structured reasoning through
    <think></think> and <response></response> tags, providing clear separation between internal thoughts and final
    outputs. The model has been trained on a carefully balanced combination of permissively licensed data and curated
    synthetic tasks.
