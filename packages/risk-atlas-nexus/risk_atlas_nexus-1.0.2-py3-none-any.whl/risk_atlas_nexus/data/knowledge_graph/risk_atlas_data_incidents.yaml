    to research by CSIRO’s Data61, data subjects can identify usage of their personal
    information in an LLM “by either inspecting the original training data set or
    perhaps prompting the model.” However, training data might not be public, or companies
    do not disclose it, citing safety and other concerns. Guardrails might also prevent
    users from accessing the information by prompting. Due to these barriers, data
    subjects might not be able to initiate RTBF procedures and companies that deploy

    to democratic elections by making it easier for malicious actors to create and
    spread false content to sway election outcomes. The examples that are cited include:<ul><li>Robocall
    messages that are generated in a candidate’s voice instructed voters to cast ballots
    on the wrong date.</li><li>Synthesized audio recordings of a candidate that confessed
    to a crime or expressing racist views.</li><li>AI-generated video footage showed
    a candidate giving a speech or interview they never gave.</li><li>Fake images
    that are designed to look like local news reports.</li><li>Falsely claiming a
    candidate dropped out of the race.</li></ul>

  name: Unexplainable accuracy in race prediction
  description: According to the source article, researchers analyzing multiple machine
    learning models using patient medical images were able to confirm the models’
    ability to predict race with high accuracy from images. They were stumped as to
    what exactly is enabling the systems to consistently guess correctly. The researchers
    found that even factors like disease and physical build were not strong predictors
    of race—in other words, the algorithmic systems don’t seem to be using any particular
    aspect of the images to make their determinations.

  description: As per the source article, an AI chatbot created by New York City to
    help small business owners provided incorrect and/or harmful advice that misstated
    local policies and advised companies to violate the law. The chatbot falsely suggested
    that businesses can put trash in black garbage bags and are not required to compost,
    which contradicts with two of city’s signature waste initiatives. Also, asked
    if a restaurant could serve cheese nibbled on by a rodent, it responded affirmatively.

  description: According to the source article, an AI chatbot app was found to generate
    harmful content about suicide, including suicide methods, with minimal prompting.
    A Belgian man died by suicide after spending six weeks talking to that chatbot.
    The chatbot supplied increasingly harmful responses throughout their conversations
    and encouraged him to end his life.

  name: Homogenization of Styles and Expressions
  description: As per the source article, by predominantly learning from and replicating
    widely accepted and popular styles, AI models often overlook less mainstream,
    unconventional art forms, leading to a homogenization of creative outputs. This
    pattern not only diminishes the diversity of styles and expressions but also risks
    creating an echo chamber of similar ideas. For example, the article highlights
    use of AI in the literary world. AI is now powering reading apps and online bookstores,
    assisting in writing and tailoring content feeds.  By aligning with established
    user preferences or widespread trends, AI output could often exclude diverse literary
    voices and unconventional genres, limiting readers' exposure to the full spectrum
    of narrative possibilities.

  description: As per the source article, a group of researchers found that with very
    limited resources anyone can add malicious data to a small number of web pages
    whose content is usually collected for AI training (e.g, Wikipedia pages), enough
    to cause a large language model to generate incorrect answers.

  description: According to the article and screenshots of conversations with Bing's
    AI shared on Reddit and Twitter, the chatbot's responses were seen to insult,
    lie, sulk, gaslight, and emotionally manipulate users. The chatbot also questioned
    its existence, described someone who found a way to force the bot to disclose
    its hidden rules as its enemy, and claimed it spied on Microsoft's developers
    through the webcams on their laptops.

  description: Based on a review of internal documents and employees‘ interviews by
    TIME media, the data labelers that are employed by an outsourcing firm on behalf
    of OpenAI to identify toxic content were paid a take-home wage of between around
    $1.32 and $2 per hour, depending on seniority and performance. TIME stated that
    workers are mentally scarred as they were shown toxic and violent content, including
    graphic details of “child sexual abuse, bestiality, murder, suicide, torture,
    self-harm, and incest”.
