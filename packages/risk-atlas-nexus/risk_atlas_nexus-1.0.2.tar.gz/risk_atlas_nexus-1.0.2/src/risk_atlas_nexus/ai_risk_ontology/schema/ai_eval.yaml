    description: "Benchmark metadata cards offer a standardized way to document LLM benchmarks clearly and transparently. Inspired by Model Cards and Datasheets, Benchmark metadata cards help researchers and practitioners understand exactly what benchmarks test, how they relate to real-world risks, and how to interpret their results responsibly.  This is an implementation of the design set out in 'BenchmarkCards: Large Language Model and Risk Reporting' (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2410.12974)"
