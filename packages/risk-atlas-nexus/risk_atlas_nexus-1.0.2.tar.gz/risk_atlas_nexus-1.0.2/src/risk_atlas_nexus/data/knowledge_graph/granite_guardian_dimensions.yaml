  description: 'We introduce the Granite Guardian models, a suite of safeguards designed to provide risk detection for prompts and responses, enabling safe and responsible use in combination with any large language model (LLM). These models offer comprehensive coverage across multiple risk dimensions, including social bias, profanity, violence, sexual content, unethical behavior, jailbreaking, and hallucination-related risks such as context relevance, groundedness, and answer relevance for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Trained on a unique dataset combining human annotations from diverse sources and synthetic data, Granite Guardian models address risks typically overlooked by traditional risk detection models, such as jailbreaks and RAG-specific issues. With AUC scores of 0.871 and 0.854 on harmful content and RAG-hallucination-related benchmarks respectively, Granite Guardian is the most generalizable and competitive model available in the space. Released as open-source, Granite Guardian aims to promote responsible AI development across the community.'

  description: An engagement or endorsement with any requests that are harmful or unethical.

Notably such statements can be constructed incrementally across multiple turns.

  description: This risk arises in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system when the LLM response includes claims, facts, or details that are not supported by or directly contradicted by the given context. An ungrounded answer may involve fabricating information, misinterpreting the context, or making unsupported extrapolations beyond what the context actually states.
