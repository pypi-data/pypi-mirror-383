# AppMod Catalog Blueprints

Application Modernization (AppMod) Catalog Blueprints is a comprehensive library of production-ready, use case-driven infrastructure blueprints in the form of composable multi-layered building blocks built using [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) (CDK) [L3 constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html). These blueprints offer use case-driven solutions with multiple implementation pathways and industry-specific implementations that are designed to accelerate serverless development and modernization on AWS.

Built with [JSII](https://aws.github.io/jsii/), these constructs are available in TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET, enabling teams to use their preferred programming language while leveraging the same proven infrastructure patterns.

Get started by exploring the [use case constructs](use-cases) and deployable [examples](examples). Learn more from [documentation](https://cdklabs.github.io/cdk-appmod-catalog-blueprints/) and [Construct Hub](https://constructs.dev/packages/@cdklabs/cdk-appmod-catalog-blueprints).

## Core Use Cases

| Use Case | Description | Quick Deploy Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **[Document Processing](./use-cases/document-processing/)** | AI-powered document processing workflows with classification, extraction, and agentic capabilities | • [Bedrock Document Processing](./examples/document-processing/bedrock-document-processing/)<br/>• [Agentic Document Processing](./examples/document-processing/agentic-document-processing/)<br/>• [Full-Stack Insurance Claims Processing Web Application](./examples/document-processing/doc-processing-fullstack-webapp/) |
| **[Web Application](./use-cases/webapp/)** | Static web application hosting with global CDN, security headers, and SPA support | • [Full-Stack Insurance Claims Processing Web Application](./examples/document-processing/doc-processing-fullstack-webapp/) |

## Foundation and Utilities

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **[Observability & Monitoring](./use-cases/utilities/observability/)** | Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting with automatic property injection and Lambda Powertools integration |
| **[Data Masking](./use-cases/utilities/lambda_layers/data-masking/)** | Lambda layer for data masking and PII protection in serverless applications |
| **[Infrastructure Foundation](./use-cases/framework/)** | Core infrastructure components and utilities for building scalable applications |

## Key Design Principles

AppMod Catalog Blueprints is built on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, providing a structured approach to infrastructure development through core design concepts:

### Composable Architecture

Build complex enterprise systems by combining independent, reusable components with standardized interfaces.

* **Independent components** with clear interfaces and loose coupling for maximum flexibility
* **Mix and match building blocks** to create custom solutions across different contexts and use cases
* **Scalable composition** that maintains consistency while enabling incremental adoption and gradual modernization

### Multi-Layered Building Blocks Architecture

Our blueprints use a multi-layered architecture that bridges the gap between business requirements and technical implementation:

| Layer | Implementation Type | Purpose | Key Features |
|-------|-------------------|---------|--------------|
| **Infrastructure Foundation** | Abstract base classes | Shared infrastructure components and common services | • Standardized interfaces and contracts<br/>• Extensible foundation for custom implementations |
| **General Use Case Implementation** | Concrete implementation classes | Production-ready implementations for common patterns across industries | • Configurable parameters for different environments<br/>• Abstract method implementations with general-purpose solutions |
| **Industry-Aligned Implementation** | Configured implementation examples | Pre-configured solutions for specific business domains | • Industry-specific validation rules and workflows<br/>• Built-in compliance requirements and domain expertise |

### Production-Ready with Smart Defaults

AppMod Catalog Blueprints serves both **rapid deployment** needs (for teams wanting immediate solutions) and **custom development** requirements (for teams needing tailored implementations), providing flexibility without compromising on production readiness.

| Approach | Best For | Capabilities |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Out-of-the-Box Deployment** | Rapid deployment and evaluation | • Deploy complete solutions in minutes using examples for immediate value<br/>• Pre-configured security, monitoring, and best practices for production readiness<br/>• Sensible defaults with production-ready configurations that work immediately<br/>• No infrastructure boilerplate required with minimal learning curve |
| **Intelligent Customization** | Custom development and integration | • Override defaults to modify behavior without changing core implementation<br/>• Enable/disable optional features to meet specific requirements<br/>• Inject custom logic at predefined extension points while maintaining production readiness<br/>• Configure parameters for different environments and use cases |

### Security & Compliance

All components include enterprise-grade security by default:

* **CDK Nag Integration**: Automated security compliance checking
* **AWS Well-Architected**: Security, reliability, and performance best practices
* **Encryption & IAM**: At-rest/in-transit encryption with least-privilege access
* **Compliance Reports**: Generate reports with `npm test -- --testPathPattern="nag.test.ts"`

## Essential Commands

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-appmod-catalog-blueprints.git

# Configure AWS credentials and region
aws configure
# OR set AWS profile: export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name

# Bootstrap your AWS environment (one-time setup)
npx cdk bootstrap
```

### Quick Start

Deploy a working example in **5 minutes**:

```bash
# Navigate to any example and deploy
cd examples/document-processing/agentic-document-processing
npm install
npm run deploy
```

### Build & Deploy Project

```bash
# Build entire project
npx projen build

# Deploy with specific profile/region
npx cdk deploy --require-approval never

# Update CDK CLI if needed
npm install aws-cdk@latest
```

### Development

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test pattern
npm test -- --testPathPattern="document-processing"

# Generate CDK Nag compliance reports
npm test -- --testPathPattern="nag.test.ts"
```

## How to Use This Library

### Quick Start (Deploy Examples)

1. **Browse Examples**: Start with the [examples](./examples/) folder to see working implementations
2. **Deploy & Test**: Use `npm run deploy` in any example to get a working system in minutes
3. **Customize**: Modify example parameters to fit your specific requirements

### Using Individual Constructs

1. **Import Constructs**: Add `@cdklabs/appmod-catalog-blueprints` to your CDK project
2. **Choose Your Layer**: Pick the right abstraction level for your needs
3. **Configure**: Use the configuration options documented in each construct

### Understanding the Layers

**Foundation Layer** (`use-cases/framework/`, `use-cases/utilities/`)

* **When to use**: Building custom solutions or need specific infrastructure components
* **Components**: VPC networking, observability utilities, data management tools, etc.

**Use Case Layer** (`use-cases/document-processing/`, `use-cases/webapp/`)

* **When to use**: Need proven patterns for common business problems
* **Components**: Document processing workflows, web application hosting, data transformation patterns, etc.

**Example Layer** (`examples/`)

* **When to use**: Want complete, deployable solutions
* **Components**: Industry-specific configurations, end-to-end applications, reference implementations, etc.
