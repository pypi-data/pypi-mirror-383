! TUFLOW CONTROL FILE (.TCF) defines the model simulation parameters and directs input from other data sources

! MODEL INITIALISATION COMMANDS  
Tutorial Model == ON                                ! This command allows for this model to be simulated without a TUFLOW licence
GIS FORMAT == SHP									! Specify SHP as the output format for all GIS files
SHP Projection == ..\model\gis\projection.prj       ! Sets the GIS projection for the TUFLOW Model
!Write Empty GIS Files == ..\model\gis\empty        ! This command is commented out. It is only needed for the project establishment

! SOLUTION SCHEME
Solution Scheme == HPC								! Heavily Parallelised Compute, uses adaptive timestepping
Hardware == GPU										! Comment out if GPU card is not available or replace with "Hardware == CPU"
SGS == ON											! Switches on Sub-Grid Sampling
SGS Approach == Method C							! SGS Sampling Approach
SGS Sample Frequency == 11							! SGS Sampling Frequency
