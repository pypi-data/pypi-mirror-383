[polars-bio](https://pypi.org/project/polars-bio/) is a Python library for genomics built on top of [polars](https://pola.rs/), [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) and [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/).
It provides a DataFrame API for genomics data and is designed to be blazing fast, memory efficient and easy to use.

## Key Features
* optimized for [performance](https://biodatageeks.org/polars-bio/performance/) and memory [efficiency](https://biodatageeks.org/polars-bio/performance/#memory-characteristics) for large-scale genomics datasets analyses both when reading input data and performing operations
* popular genomics [operations](https://biodatageeks.org/polars-bio/features/#genomic-ranges-operations) with a DataFrame API (both [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [polars](https://pola.rs/))
* [SQL](https://biodatageeks.org/polars-bio/features/#sql-powered-data-processing)-powered bioinformatic data querying or manipulation
* native parallel engine powered by Apache DataFusion and [sequila-native](https://github.com/biodatageeks/sequila-native)
* [out-of-core/streaming](https://biodatageeks.org/polars-bio/features/#streaming) processing (for data too large to fit into a computer's main memory)  with [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/) and [polars](https://pola.rs/)
* support for *federated* and *streamed* reading data from [cloud storages](https://biodatageeks.org/polars-bio/features/#cloud-storage) (e.g. S3, GCS) with [Apache OpenDAL](https://github.com/apache/opendal) enabling processing large-scale genomics data without materializing in memory
* zero-copy data exchange with [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)
* bioinformatics file [formats](https://biodatageeks.org/polars-bio/features/#file-formats-support) with [noodles](https://github.com/zaeleus/noodles)
* fast overlap operations with [COITrees: Cache Oblivious Interval Trees](https://github.com/dcjones/coitrees)
* pre-built wheel packages for *Linux*, *Windows* and *MacOS* (*arm64* and *x86_64*) available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/polars-bio/#files)
