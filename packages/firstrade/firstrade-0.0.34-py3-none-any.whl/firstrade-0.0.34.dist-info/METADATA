# firstrade-api

A reverse-engineered python API to interact with the Firstrade Trading platform.

This is not an official api! This api's functionality may change at any time.

This api provides a means of buying and selling stocks through Firstrade. It uses the Session class from requests to get authorization cookies. The rest is done with reverse engineered requests to Firstrade's API.

In order to use Fractional shares you must accept the agreement on the website before using it in this API.
