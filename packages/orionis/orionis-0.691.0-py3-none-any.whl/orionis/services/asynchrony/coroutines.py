        """
        Initialize a Coroutine wrapper for managing and executing coroutine objects.

        This constructor accepts either a coroutine object directly or a callable that
        returns a coroutine when invoked. The wrapped coroutine can later be executed
        using the run() method with automatic context detection.

        Parameters
        ----------
        func : Union[TypingCoroutine[Any, Any, T], Callable[..., TypingCoroutine[Any, Any, T]]]
            The coroutine object to be wrapped and managed, or a callable that returns
            a coroutine. This will be stored internally for later execution.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This is a constructor method and does not return any value.

        Notes
        -----
        - The coroutine type validation is performed during execution in the run() method,
          not during initialization.
        - Both coroutine objects and coroutine functions are accepted as valid input.

        """
        Invoke the callable coroutine function with the provided arguments.

        This method executes a callable coroutine function or regular function with the given
        arguments and keyword arguments. It automatically detects the execution context and
        handles both synchronous and asynchronous execution appropriately.

        Parameters
        ----------
        *args : tuple
            Positional arguments to pass to the callable function.
        **kwargs : dict
            Keyword arguments to pass to the callable function.

        Returns
        -------
        Union[T, asyncio.Task, None]
            - T: The result of the coroutine if executed synchronously
            - asyncio.Task: A task object if scheduled for asynchronous execution
            - None: If the callable is not a coroutine function

        Raises
        ------
        OrionisCoroutineException
            If an error occurs during coroutine execution.
        RuntimeError
            If an error occurs during callable execution that is not coroutine-related.

        Notes
        -----
        - Only callable objects can be invoked with this method
        - For coroutine functions, execution context is automatically detected
        - Non-coroutine callables are executed directly and return None
        - Exceptions are wrapped with appropriate context information

        Examples
        --------
        >>> async def my_coro(x, y):
        ...     return x + y
        >>> coro = Coroutine(my_coro)
        >>> result = coro.invoke(1, 2)  # Returns Task or result depending on context
