        Indicates whether timestamps will be shown in the command output.
    signature : str
        The command signature.

        Executes all automated tests using the configured test kernel.

        This method retrieves the test kernel instance from the application container
        and executes the test suite by invoking the kernel's handle method. If any
        exception occurs during execution, it raises a CLIOrionisRuntimeError with
        the error details.

        Parameters
        ----------
        app : IApplication
            The Orionis application instance providing access to the service container.

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            A dictionary containing the results of the test execution, such as test
            statuses, counts, or other relevant information.

        Raises
        ------
        CLIOrionisRuntimeError
            If an unexpected error occurs during the execution of the test command.
