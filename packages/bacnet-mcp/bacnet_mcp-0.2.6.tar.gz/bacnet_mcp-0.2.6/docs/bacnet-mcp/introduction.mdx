The [BACnet MCP Server](https://github.com/ezhuk/bacnet-mcp) is a lightweight [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that connects LLM agents to [BACnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BACnet) devices in a secure, standardized way, enabling seamless integration of AI-driven workflows with Building Automation (BAS), Building Management (BMS) and Industrial Control (ICS) systems, allowing agents to monitor real-time sensor data, actuate devices, and orchestrate complex automation tasks.
