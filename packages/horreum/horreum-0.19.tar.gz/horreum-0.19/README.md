## Development

Install poetry dependency (consider using Python virtual environments):
```bash
pip install --constraint=./dev-constraints.txt poetry
poetry --version
```

Generate source files
```bash
make generate
```

Build the library using `poetry`:
```bash
poetry build
```

### Tests
Tests can be executed using [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/) sessions.

To install it in your local environment, please run:
```bash
pip install --constraint=./dev-constraints.txt nox nox-poetry
nox --version
```

To check available sessions, run:
```bash
nox -l
```

And execute them by running:
```
nox -s <session>
```

Right now integrations tests are not fully automated, therefore you need to start up the Horreum server manually,
you can check more details in [Horreum README](https://github.com/Hyperfoil/Horreum/blob/master/README.md#getting-started-with-development-server).

> **_NOTE_**: The database should be empty to get all tests working

Once the Horreum server is up and running on `localhost:8080`, you can trigger integration tests by running:
```bash
nox -s its
```

## Release
