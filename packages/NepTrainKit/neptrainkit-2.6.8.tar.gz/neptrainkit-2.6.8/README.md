# NepTrainKit

**NepTrainKit** is a toolkit focused on the operation and visualization of **neuroevolution potential** (NEP) training datasets. It is mainly used to simplify and optimize the NEP model training process, providing an intuitive graphical interface and analysis tools to help users adjust  train dataset.

## Installation

> **It is strongly recommended to use pip for installation.**

### Method 1: Install via pip

If you are using Python 3.10 or a later version, you can install `NepTrainKit` using an environment manager like `conda`:

1. Create a new environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n nepkit python=3.10
   ```

2. Activate the environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate nepkit
   ```

3. For CentOS users, install PySide6 (required for GUI functionality):

   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge pyside6
   ```

- Install directly using the `pip install` command:

  ```bash
  pip install NepTrainKit
  ```

  > **Linux note:** When you install NepTrainKit via pip on Linux, the build auto-detects CUDA. If a compatible CUDA toolkit is present, the NEP backend is compiled with GPU acceleration; otherwise, it falls back to a CPU-only build.

  After installation, you can call the program using either `NepTrainKit` or `nepkit`.

- For the **latest version** (from GitHub):

  ```bash
  pip install git+https://github.com/aboys-cb/NepTrainKit.git
  ```

---

### Method 2: Windows Executable

A standalone executable is available for Windows users.

- Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/aboys-cb/NepTrainKit/releases) page
- Download `NepTrainKit.win32.zip`

 > Note: Only supported on Windows platforms.

### GPU Acceleration (optional)

- NepTrainKit includes an optional GPU‑accelerated NEP backend.
- Requirements: NVIDIA GPU/driver compatible with CUDA 12.4 runtime.
- Selection: In the app, go to Settings → NEP Backend and choose Auto/CPU/GPU.
  - Auto tries GPU first and falls back to CPU if unavailable.
  - Adjust GPU Batch Size to balance speed and memory.
  - If you see “CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version”, switch to CPU.
