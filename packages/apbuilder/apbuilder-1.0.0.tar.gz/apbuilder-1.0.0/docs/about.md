# Atmospheric Profile Builder (APBuilder)

The APBuilder is a tool to create [AC2Dr](https://github.com/LLNL/AC2Dr) atmosphere profiles by
downloading a weather model and making transformations to generate the 1D or 2D binary profile.
The binary profile is used as an input to AC2Dr.

AC2Dr is a 2-D numerical solver for the acoustic wave equation using the finite difference method.
