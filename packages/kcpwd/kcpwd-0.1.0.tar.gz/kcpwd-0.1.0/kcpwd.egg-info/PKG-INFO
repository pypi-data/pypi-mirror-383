# kcpwd

**Keychain Password Manager CLI** - A simple, secure command-line password manager for macOS that uses the native macOS Keychain.

## Features

- 🔐 Secure storage using macOS Keychain
- 📋 Automatic clipboard copying
- 🚀 Simple CLI interface
- 🔒 No passwords stored in plain text
- 🍎 Native macOS integration

## Installation

### From PyPI
```bash
pip install kcpwd
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/osmanuygar/kcpwd.git
cd kcpwd
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Store a password
```bash
kcpwd set dbadmin asd123
```

### Retrieve a password (copies to clipboard)
```bash
kcpwd get dbadmin
```

### Delete a password
```bash
kcpwd delete dbadmin
```

### List stored keys
```bash
kcpwd list
```

## How It Works

`kcpwd` stores your passwords in the **macOS Keychain** - the same secure, encrypted storage that Safari and other macOS apps use. This means:

- Passwords are encrypted with your Mac's security
- They persist across reboots
- They're protected by your Mac's login password
- No plain text files or databases

### Viewing Your Passwords

Open **Keychain Access** app and search for "kcpwd" to see all stored passwords.

Or use Terminal:
```bash
security find-generic-password -s "kcpwd" -a "dbadmin" -w
```

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Security Considerations:**

- Passwords are stored in macOS Keychain (encrypted)
- Passwords remain in clipboard until you copy something else
- Consider clearing clipboard after use for sensitive passwords
- Designed for personal use on trusted devices
- Always use strong, unique passwords

## Requirements

- **macOS only** (uses native Keychain)
- Python 3.8+

## Development

### Setup development environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Run tests
```bash
pytest
```
