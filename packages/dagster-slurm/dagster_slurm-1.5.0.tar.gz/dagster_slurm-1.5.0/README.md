# dagster-slurm

Integrating dagster to orchestrate slurm jobs for distributed systems like ray for a better developer experience on supercomputers.

As part of the hackathon (https://www.openhackathons.org/s/siteevent/a0CUP000013Tp8f2AC/se000375) we intend to work on this integration.
We are looking for more hands to join in - or review the task list so that we can make sure we are not missing anything.

- Tasks for implementation: https://github.com/orgs/ascii-supply-networks/projects/4
- Project lives here https://github.com/ascii-supply-networks/dagster-slurm

See the (draft) [documentation](https://ascii-supply-networks.github.io/dagster-slurm/)

> We are actively looking for contributions to bring this package to life together
