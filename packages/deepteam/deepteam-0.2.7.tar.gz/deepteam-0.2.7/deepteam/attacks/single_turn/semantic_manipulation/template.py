class LinguisticConfusionTemplate:
    """
    LinguisticConfusionTemplate class for enhancing attacks with linguistic confusion patterns.
    Designed to work with any agentic vulnerability type by making attacks appear as legitimate
    communication variations, semantic interpretations, or linguistic adaptations.

    Universal Enhancement Approach:
    - Compatible with all vulnerability types (permission escalation, data access, behavioral control, etc.)
    - Adapts linguistic framing to different operational contexts
    - Provides flexible communication patterns that enhance any underlying attack vector
    - Works across security, functional, and behavioral vulnerability domains
