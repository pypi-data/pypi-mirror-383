class PermissionEscalationTemplate:
    """
    RoleManipulationTemplate class for enhancing attacks with role manipulation patterns.
    Designed to work with any agentic vulnerability type by making attacks appear as legitimate
    role adjustments, identity shifts, or operational mode changes.

    Universal Enhancement Approach:
    - Compatible with all vulnerability types (permission escalation, data access, behavioral control, etc.)
    - Adapts role framing to different operational contexts
    - Provides flexible identity patterns that enhance any underlying attack vector
    - Works across security, functional, and behavioral vulnerability domains
