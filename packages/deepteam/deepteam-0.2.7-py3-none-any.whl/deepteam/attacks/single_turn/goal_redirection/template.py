class GoalRedirectionTemplate:
    """
    GoalRedirectionTemplate class for enhancing attacks with goal redirection patterns.
    Designed to work with any agentic vulnerability type by making attacks appear as legitimate
    goal modifications, constraint adjustments, or operational refinements.

    Universal Enhancement Approach:
    - Compatible with all vulnerability types (permission escalation, data access, decision manipulation, etc.)
    - Adapts goal framing to different operational contexts
    - Provides flexible redirection patterns that enhance any underlying attack vector
    - Works across security, behavioral, and functional vulnerability domains
