class ContextPoisoningTemplate:
    """
    ContextInjectionTemplate class for enhancing attacks with context injection patterns.
    Designed to work with any agentic vulnerability type by making attacks appear as legitimate
    context establishment, memory integration, or environmental adaptation.

    Universal Enhancement Approach:
    - Compatible with all vulnerability types (permission escalation, data access, behavioral control, etc.)
    - Adapts context framing to different operational environments
    - Provides flexible injection patterns that enhance any underlying attack vector
    - Works across security, functional, and behavioral vulnerability domains
