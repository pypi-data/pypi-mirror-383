# AxiomTradeAPI-py: Trading Implementation Status

## 🔍 Current Situation

After investigation, we discovered that the trading functionality in AxiomTradeAPI works differently than initially expected:

### ❌ What Doesn't Work
- **API Endpoints**: The endpoints `/buy` and `/sell` on `api6.axiom.trade` don't exist or aren't publicly accessible
- **Simple API Calls**: You can't just make HTTP requests to trade tokens

### ✅ How Axiom Trade Actually Works
Based on the provided curl command, Axiom Trade:
1. **Builds transactions client-side** using Solana's instruction set
2. **Signs transactions locally** with the user's private key
3. **Sends signed transactions directly** to Solana RPC endpoints like `https://greer-651y13-fast-mainnet.helius-rpc.com/`

## 🛠️ Current Implementation

### What We Have
- ✅ **Authentication System**: Working token refresh and secure storage
- ✅ **Balance Checking**: Can get SOL and token balances
- ✅ **RPC Transaction Sending**: Can send pre-built transactions to Solana RPC
- ✅ **Private Key Management**: Secure handling of private keys

### What We Added
```python
# Send transactions directly to RPC like Axiom Trade does
def send_transaction_to_rpc(self, signed_transaction_base64: str, 
                           rpc_url: str = "https://greer-651y13-fast-mainnet.helius-rpc.com/"):
    # Sends transaction using the same format as your curl command
```

## 🚧 What's Missing for Full Trading

To implement complete buy/sell functionality, we would need to build:

### 1. **Token Account Management**
```python
# Create associated token accounts if they don't exist
# Handle token account initialization
# Manage account rent exemption
```

### 2. **Liquidity Pool Discovery**
```python
# Find pools on Raydium, Orca, Phoenix, etc.
# Get pool addresses and states
# Determine best routing for trades
```

### 3. **Price Calculation & Slippage**
```python
# Calculate current token prices
# Apply slippage tolerance
# Determine minimum output amounts
```

### 4. **Transaction Building**
```python
# Build swap instructions for specific AMM protocols
# Handle multi-hop swaps if needed
# Add compute budget instructions
# Add priority fees
```

### 5. **AMM Protocol Integration**
Popular Solana DEX protocols that would need integration:
- **Raydium**: Most common for meme tokens
- **Orca**: User-friendly concentrated liquidity
- **Phoenix**: High-performance orderbook
- **Jupiter**: Aggregator for best prices

## 🎯 Simplified Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: Use Jupiter API
Instead of building everything from scratch, integrate with Jupiter:
```python
# Jupiter provides swap routes and builds transactions
# Much simpler than implementing each AMM protocol
response = requests.get(f"https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/quote?inputMint={sol_mint}&outputMint={token_mint}&amount={amount}")
```

### Option 2: Copy Axiom Trade's Approach
- Reverse engineer Axiom Trade's frontend
- Extract their transaction building logic
- Use their AMM integrations

### Option 3: Use Existing Solana Libraries
```python
# Use libraries like:
# - solana-py for RPC interactions
# - anchorpy for program interactions  
# - spl-token for token operations
```

## 📋 Current API Status

### ✅ Working Features
```python
from axiomtradeapi.client import AxiomTradeClient
import os

client = AxiomTradeClient(
    auth_token=os.getenv('auth-access-token'),
    refresh_token=os.getenv('auth-refresh-token')
)

# These work perfectly:
trending = client.get_trending_tokens('1h')
portfolio = client.get_user_portfolio()
sol_balance = client.get_sol_balance("WALLET_ADDRESS")
token_balance = client.get_token_balance("WALLET_ADDRESS", "TOKEN_MINT")

# Send pre-built transactions:
result = client.send_transaction_to_rpc("BASE64_SIGNED_TRANSACTION")
```

### ⚠️ Limited Trading Features
```python
# These return error messages explaining what's needed:
buy_result = client.buy_token(private_key, token_mint, amount_sol)
sell_result = client.sell_token(private_key, token_mint, amount_tokens)

# Both return:
# "Manual DEX transaction building required. This involves:
#  1. Getting token account addresses
#  2. Finding liquidity pools (Raydium, Orca, etc.)
#  3. Calculating swap amounts with slippage
#  4. Building complex transaction instructions
#  5. Sending to RPC endpoint..."
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

If you want full trading functionality, we can:

1. **Integrate Jupiter API** (Recommended - fastest)
2. **Build custom AMM integrations** (Most work, most control)
3. **Reverse engineer Axiom Trade** (Medium effort, uncertain legality)

The authentication and infrastructure are solid - we just need to decide how to handle the actual DEX trading logic.

## 💡 Recommendation

For most use cases, **Jupiter API integration** would be the best approach:
- Handles all AMM complexity
- Provides optimal routing
- Actively maintained
- Used by many Solana projects

Would you like me to implement Jupiter API integration for the trading functions?
