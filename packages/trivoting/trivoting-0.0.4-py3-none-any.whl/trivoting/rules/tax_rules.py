    Apply a participatory budgeting rule to a trichotomous profile by translating it into a suitable PB instance with
    opposition tax.

    This function converts the given profile into a PB instance and profile,
    applies the specified PB rule using pabutools, and converts the results back.

    The taxed PB rule scheme has been defined in Section 4.2 of
    ``Proportionality in Thumbs Up and Down Voting`` (Kraiczy, Papasotiropoulos, Pierczyński and Skowron, 2025).

    In case there are alternatives whose corresponding projects have cost 0, it can happen that too many projects are
    selected on the PB side. In this case, the tie breaking function is used to select the right number of alternatives.
