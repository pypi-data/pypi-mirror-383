## üî• Motivations / Why you need it

**ps:** this section is optional, you can jump into [Getting Started](#-getting-started) directly if already capture the ideas from simple description above.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Matters

The same concerns as highlighted by the creator of [dangerzone](https://dangerzone.rocks/about/) how a malicious office document can potentially harm/hack your local machine and use container sandboxed env as the solution.

In software or infra engineering the threads cames from a wider factors, these are some samples:

- Typo in dependency name ([Dependency Confusion](https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610)).
- Malicious library that steal sensitive data ([a news about it](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/malicious-python-packages-on-pypi.html)).
- Poisoned dependency that affecting commonly used tools (sample: [CVE-2024-3094](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-3094)).
- a Crypto exchange loss $18.2 million due to an internal engineering employee executing malicious program ([source](https://voi.id/en/economy/419008)).

`sandock` is not aimed as a silver bullet solution, but at least it can reduce or mitigate some of the potential security issues.

### üß™ Experiment Without Sweat

Have you ever want to try/install a latest or specific version of an CLI application or programming language but turns out it's makes your local workstation became messed ?

The container approach already solve this and `sandock` comes as the bridge in seemless user experience.


### üóëÔ∏è Isolated and Composible Environment

Reproduceable environment is a hot topic now days and can be achived easly by using container. In software development side there is [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/supporting) with a wide adoption.

`sandock` fill the gap in one lined command execution with a fresh/consistent environment or it can be extended in to isolated user's shell environment.

## ‚úÖ Features

- **Seamless user experience**, execute container program as is been installed in your local workstation, all of the command argument are forwarded to executeable inside container.
- **Program execution shortcuts**, Generate the command shortcuts and with support in defines `aliases` for each executeable inside a container.
- **Auto container dependencies create**, for the custom network, volume and image.
- **Chained/Recursive container build**, by using config `depends_on` in the image declaration.
- **Prevent home dir to be mounted**, as the opposite of [distrobox's behaviour](https://distrobox.it/#security-implications) in share/expose home directory to the container, unless it allowed per program config.
- **Directory configuration**, you can have specific config per folder and it can be excluded by regex patterns.
- **Merged configuration**, if you have main configuration defined with it's `includes` and directory configuration. then all of them will be joined together.
- **Override configuration per program**, at some point you need to change the network type in specific program ?, no need to edit it's config. it will be handled by `--sandbox-arg-*`, and it's adjustable !!.
- **Container Volume Backup**, use (containered) [restic](https://restic.net/) as volume backup solution. means you will have the compressed and encrypted backup on your plate.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Requirements

- Python version >= 3.9 ([the lowest LTS](https://devguide.python.org/versions/#supported-versions) as per this text written).
- Docker installed (or any compactible/drop in, eg: [podman](https://podman.io/), [nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl)).
- [OPTIONAL] [pipx installed](https://github.com/pypa/pipx?tab=readme-ov-file#install-pipx)

### 2. Installation

Basically, `sandock` only use Python's builtins except you will use **yaml** based configuration with it's strong points ([anchor, multiline, commenting, etc](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/)) that needs to install additional package, just change the package name from `sandock` to `'sandock[yml-config]'`.

> [!NOTE]
> we strongly suggest to use [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/#installing-pipx) for easier in managing the downloaded executeable.

```bash
pip install sandock
```

**note:** for the upgrade just provide with arg `--upgrade`

Locate where the executeable script has been installed

```
which sandock
```

If you unsure where the executeable is located, run following command to find it.

```bash
pip show sandock | grep "Location: " | awk '{ print $2 }' | sed 's/lib.*$/bin/g'
```

then create a symbolic link to where your env var `$PATH` located.

**Another way**, if you use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) set the following line into it's pinned version file.

```toml
[tools]
"pipx:sandock" = { version = "[VERSION]", extras = "yml-config" }
```

### 3. Create Configuration File

Initialize configuration file, example:

```bash
cat <<EOF > ~/.sandock.json
{
  "programs": {
    "ruby3.3": {
      "image": "ruby:3.3.8-slim-bookworm",
      "exec": "ruby",
      "aliases": {
        "irb": "/usr/local/bin/irb",
        "bundle": "/usr/local/bin/bundle",
        "gem": "/usr/local/bin/gem",
        "sh": "/bin/bash"
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

See [Configuration section](#Ô∏è-configuration) for more information about it.

### 4. Configure the shortcuts

> [!NOTE]
>
> This step is optional, skip it if not intended to have a program's shortcut

Run `alias` subcommand to generate alias shortcut in executing program, then set in shell profile (asuming zsh) to read it

```bash
sandock alias --expand > ~/.sandock_aliases
echo "source ~/.sandock_aliases" >> ~/.zshrc
```

alternatively, just add following line in your shell profile.

```bash
eval "$(sandock alias --expand)"
```

**note:** argument `--expand` will include the program's aliases in generated output, from the sample config above you can have shortcut `ruby3.3-bundle` in executing command `bundle` inside container.

### 5. Test it

Create a temporary folder as the place where to run the isolated script.

```bash
mkdir /tmp/test_sandock
cd /tmp/test_sandock
```

create a dummy script

```bash
cat <<EOF > hello.rb
puts "hello world"
puts "from: ruby #{ RUBY_VERSION }p#{ RUBY_PATCHLEVEL }"
puts "current location: #{ File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__)) }"
EOF
```

Then execute

```bash
sandock run ruby3.3 hello.rb
```

or if you create the alias/shortcut in previous step.

```bash
ruby3.3 hello.rb
```

execute it's `sh` alias.

```bash
ruby3.3-sh
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

It's supported **json** and **yaml** based content configuration (as long as the module installed [ref](#2-installation)).
You can find the some of the samples in [examples](./examples/).

### Lookup

This defines how `sandock` ordering lookup the main config file, if one condition is met then it will not proceed to next.

1. as explicit mentioned by argument `--config`.
1. the env var by name `SNDK_CFG`.
1. dot config in the home directory `$HOME/.sandock[FORMAT]`, see [Dot Config](#dot-config) for more.
1. dot config in current directory, [Dot Config](#dot-config) for more.
1. üíÄ raise an exception for no main configuration can be read.

### Dot Config

dot config configuration file ordered by the format:

1. **.sandock.yml**
1. **.sandock.yaml**
1. **.sandock.json**
1. **.sandock** (the contents will be treat as json formatted)

See how it can be done in variable **CONFIG_FORMAT_DECODER_MAPS** inside [sandbox.config](./sandock/config.py).

### Reuseable Property

You can use `fetch_prop(location.to.declaration)`, the feature is similar with [Gitlab's reference](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/yaml_optimization/#reference-tags). by following rules:

- to reduce uneeded call when not used this feature is disable by default, set env `SNDK_FETCH_PROP` by value `yes`
- must provide the full path/location
- if the caller is member of list and it will include another property as list then it will be flatten. sample:

  ```yaml
  programs:
    satu:
      volumes:
        - here:/here
        - there:/there

    dua:
      volumes:
        - dir_top:/top
        - fetch_prop(programs.satu.volumes)
  ```

  then value of `.programs.dua.volumes` is
  ```yaml
  - dir_top:/top
  - here:/here
  - there:/there
  ```

## Commands

> [!NOTE]
>
> to enable debug mode, you can set argument **--debug** or set env var **SNDK_DEBUG** with value **true** as follow

### run

execute program, all of arguments will be forwarded to the executeable. except for that begins with `--sandbox-arg-*` as the overrides to program's config property ([get list of overrides](#how-to-get-the-list-of-override-arguments-)). special to `--sandbox-arg-exec` it will lookup first by the list of config `.programs[name].aliases`, if it's mapped then the executeable will be followed.

```text
usage: sandock run [-h] program ...

run program

positional arguments:
  program
  program_args  arguments that will be forwarded, excluded for the override args

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
```

### list

list all available programs

```text
usage: sandock list [-h]

list available sandboxed program, the name also added with a prefix name if configured

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

### alias

create shell (bash, zsh) aliases for each command, use **--expand** for also generates the program

```text
print the list of alias as a shortcut to ran the programs, this should be added in shell profile configuration

positional arguments:
  program_args  program argument that will be forwarded

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  --expand      include with aliases
```

### volume

list all of volume that created by `sandock` and also related to it's backup.

```text
usage: sandock volume [-h] {list,backup} ...

manage container volumes

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit

volume action:
  {list,backup}
    list         list all volume that created by sandock
    backup       backup related command
```

#### volume - backup

```text
usage: sandock volume backup [-h] [-a] [--target TARGET] [-e EXCLUDE] {snapshot,restore,restic} ...

positional arguments:
  {snapshot,restore,restic}
    snapshot            show all existing backup snapshot, by default it's only shown the latest one
    restore             backup - volume restore command
    restic              backup - restic, direct restic command execution. use with cautions !!!

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a, --all             backup all volumes based mentioned labels in configuration
  --target TARGET       specific volume name that will be set as target backup
  -e EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE
                        explicit exclude volume to backup
```

sample backup-restore workflows:

1. create a backup for specific volume, this also initiate restic backup repostory if not exists, will prompt for the backup's password if config `.backup.no_password` set to `False` (default).
    ```sh
    sandock volume backup --target=target_vol
    ```
1. show the backup snapshots with it's id, will shown to the latest one (default).
    ```sh
    sandock volume backup snapshot
    ```
1. restore the backup to a new volume, if it's the existing one then provide with `--force` argument.
    ```sh    
    sandock volume backup restore -i [SNAPSHOT_ID] --vol=test_restore
    ```

## üîß Development

**note:** for better and identical environment, i suggest to use [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) instead.

### Requirements

- [Task](https://taskfile.dev)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

### Dev Dependencies

> [!NOTE]
> Optionally you can create environment variable

Run following command

```sh
poetry install --with=dev
```

### Shortcuts

- `task test`, run unit test.
- `task tidy`, make code tidier using [black](https://github.com/psf/black). you might execute this before running style check linter.
- `task lint`, run style and type check.
- `task test-all`, combine unit test and style+type check.

to list the others `task --list-all`

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Where the word `sandock` comes from ?

It consist of "sand" for **sandboxing** and "dock" for **docker** as representative of container engine that being used.
in other hand the pronunciation is similar to Indonesian word [Sendok](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendok) that means "spoon" where it set as the logo.

### How to make it more "secure" ?

These are what i can suggest:

- use the least privileges on container side (non root user, etc).
- drop all capabilities by default and add some if it's required.
- add security opt [no-new-privileges](https://docs.mirantis.com/mke/3.8/install/plan-deployment/mcr-considerations/no-new-privileges.html).
- disable auto mount sanbox or set it as readonly (**.programs[name].sandbox_mount.read_only**).
- use [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/) as the container engine.

### How to get the list of override arguments ?

Pass with argument `--sandbox-arg-help` to see all of available one.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> The prefix can be adjusted as config **.execution.property_override_prefix_arg**

### Can it be used in application development ?

Yes, but if it's requires a lot of IDE integrations (auto complete, etc) just use devcontainer instead.

### Why there are 2 kind of configuration format ?

Short answer: **Because it's possible :)**

It was not intended actually, since to create a config object ([dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)) is as simple as provide the `dict` that will be mapped automatically to it's properties. means you can extend it to another parser (eg: [toml](https://pypi.org/project/tomli/)).

But i just want make it as an optional as possible, so the bare minimum one is that cames as the builtin (json).

### How to ignore some files or folder inside volume to be backuped ?

- Create a file by name `.sandock_backup_ignore` inside volume.
- Put the list of folders and/or files inside it.
- It utilizing restic's `--exclude-file`, see it's [documentation page](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/040_backup.html#excluding-files) for more explanations and samples

### I use temporary shell frequently (eg: CloudShell), `sandock` is recreating my custom image in every new session and it takes time. How to make it consistent and faster ?

You can utilize feature automatically dump image as tar file (you can assume it's a cache) that will be located on your persisted home directory. it will check and load it if your custom image not exists.
see configuration **.programs[name].build.dump** or **.images[name].dump** for more details.
