    """
    Select an implementation by weighting satisfiable types and predicates.

    If any type or predicate is directly violated, exclude that implementation.
    If no matching implementation is found, raise an exception.

    Prior to PEP 484 and numerous compound types (Union[] specifically), it
    was possible to rank matches. That is no longer coherent.  For example:

      >>> class SpecialInt(int):
      ...     pass
      ...
      >>> n = SpecialInt(13)
      >>> type(n).mro()
      [<class '__main__.SpecialInt'>, <class 'int'>, <class 'object'>]

    In some sense, `n` is "most like" a SpecialInt, a bit less like an int,
    and just nominally like an object.  In this simple case, we can rank or
    weight such distances in evaluating several candidate implementations.

      >>> def add(a: int, b: int | float | complex):
      ...     return a + b
      ...
      >>> add(SpecialInt(13), SpecialInt(12))
      25

    We can sensibly measure the "fit" of the match of the first argument, but
    we cannot do so for the second argument.  It's simply a match or non-match.
    We weight types by the following rules:

      * If a type is incompatible with an argument, we subtract -sys.maxsize.
      * If a type is compatible with typing.Any, we add +5 to the score.
      * If a type is compatible with a UnionType, we add +10 to the score.
      * If a type is compatible with a simple type, we add +20 to the score.
      * If a type is compatible with a simple type, but farther removed in its
        MRO, subtract -1 for each step in the MRO.

    If two signatures match on types (or are equally weighted, in any case),
    then the predicates are weighted as follows:

      * If both predicates are satisfied, the first implementation is chosen.
      * If only one predicate is satisfied, that implementation is chosen.
      * If one predicate is absent, the more specific implementation is chosen.
