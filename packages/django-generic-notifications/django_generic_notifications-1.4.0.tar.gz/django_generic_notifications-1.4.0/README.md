# Django Generic Notifications

A flexible, multi-channel notification system for Django applications with built-in support for email digests, user preferences, and extensible delivery channels.

## Features

- **Multi-channel delivery**: Send notifications through multiple channels (website, email, and custom channels)
- **Flexible email frequencies**: Support for real-time and digest emails (daily, or custom schedules)
- **Notification grouping**: Prevent repeated notifications by grouping notifications based on your own custom logic
- **User preferences**: Fine-grained control over notification types and delivery channels
- **Extensible architecture**: Easy to add custom notification types, channels, and frequencies
- **Generic relations**: Link notifications to any Django model
- **Template support**: Customizable email templates for each notification type
- **Developer friendly**: Simple API for sending notifications with automatic channel routing
- **Full type hints**: Complete type annotations for better IDE support and type checking

## Installation

All instruction in this document use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), but of course pip or Poetry will also work just fine.

```bash
uv add django-generic-notifications
```

Add to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    "generic_notifications",
    ...
]
```

Run migrations:

```bash
uv run ./manage.py migrate generic_notifications
```

## Settings

### `NOTIFICATION_BASE_URL`

Configure the base URL for generating absolute URLs in email notifications:

```python
# With protocol (recommended)
NOTIFICATION_BASE_URL = "https://www.example.com"
NOTIFICATION_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"

# Without protocol (auto-detects based on DEBUG setting)
NOTIFICATION_BASE_URL = "www.example.com"
```

**Protocol handling**: If you omit the protocol, it's automatically added:
- `https://` in production (`DEBUG = False`)  
- `http://` in development (`DEBUG = True`)

**Fallback order** if `NOTIFICATION_BASE_URL` is not set:
1. `BASE_URL` setting  
2. `SITE_URL` setting
3. Django Sites framework (if `django.contrib.sites` is installed)
4. URLs remain relative if no base URL is found (not ideal in emails!)

## Quick Start

### 1. Define a notification type

```python
# myapp/notifications.py
from generic_notifications.types import NotificationType, register

@register
class CommentNotification(NotificationType):
    key = "comment"
    name = "Comment Notifications"
    description = "When someone comments on your posts"
```

### 2. Send a notification

```python
from generic_notifications import send_notification
from myapp.notifications import CommentNotification

# Send a notification (only `recipient` and `notification_type` are required)
notification = send_notification(
    recipient=post.author,
    notification_type=CommentNotification,
    actor=comment.user,
    target=post,
    subject=f"{comment.user.get_full_name()} commented on your post",
    text=f"{comment.user.get_full_name()} left a comment: {comment.text[:100]}",
    url=f"/posts/{post.id}#comment-{comment.id}",
)
```

### 3. Set up email digest sending

Create a cron job to send daily digests:

```bash
# Send daily digests at 9 AM
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/project && uv run ./manage.py send_digest_emails --frequency daily
```

## User Preferences

By default every user gets notifications of all registered types delivered to every registered channel, but users can opt-out of receiving notification types, per channel.

All notification types default to daily digest, except for `SystemMessage` which defaults to real-time. Users can choose  different frequency per notification type.

This project doesn't come with a UI (view + template) for managing user preferences, but an example is provided in the [example app](#example-app).

### Using the preference helpers

The library does provide helper functions to simplify building preference management UIs:

```python
from generic_notifications.preferences import (
    get_notification_preferences,
    save_notification_preferences
)

# Get preferences for display in a form
# Returns a list of dicts with notification types, channels, and current settings
preferences = get_notification_preferences(user)

# Save preferences from form data
# Form field format: {notification_type_key}__{channel_key} and {notification_type_key}__frequency
save_notification_preferences(user, request.POST)
```

### Manual preference management

You can also manage preferences directly:

```python
from generic_notifications.models import DisabledNotificationTypeChannel, EmailFrequency
from generic_notifications.channels import EmailChannel
from generic_notifications.frequencies import RealtimeFrequency
from myapp.notifications import CommentNotification

# Disable email channel for comment notifications
CommentNotification.disable_channel(user=user, channel=EmailChannel)

# Change to realtime digest for a notification type
CommentNotification.set_email_frequency(user=user, frequency=RealtimeFrequency)
```

## Custom Channels

Create custom delivery channels:

```python
from generic_notifications.channels import NotificationChannel, register

@register
class SMSChannel(NotificationChannel):
    key = "sms"
    name = "SMS"

    def process(self, notification):
        # Send SMS using your preferred service
        send_sms(
            to=notification.recipient.phone_number,
            message=notification.get_text()
        )
```

## Custom Frequencies

Add custom email frequencies:

```python
from generic_notifications.frequencies import NotificationFrequency, register

@register
class WeeklyFrequency(NotificationFrequency):
    key = "weekly"
    name = "Weekly digest"
    is_realtime = False
    description = "Receive a weekly summary every Monday"
```

When you add custom email frequencies youâ€™ll have to run `send_digest_emails` for them as well. For example, if you created that weekly digest:

```bash
# Send weekly digest every Monday at 9 AM
0 9 * * 1 cd /path/to/project && uv run ./manage.py send_digest_emails --frequency weekly
```

## Email Templates

Customize email templates by creating these files in your templates directory:

### Real-time emails

- `notifications/email/realtime/{notification_type}_subject.txt`
- `notifications/email/realtime/{notification_type}.html`
- `notifications/email/realtime/{notification_type}.txt`

### Digest emails

- `notifications/email/digest/subject.txt`
- `notifications/email/digest/message.html`
- `notifications/email/digest/message.txt`

## Admin Integration

While the library doesn't register admin classes by default, the [example app](#example-app) includes [admin configuration](https://github.com/loopwerk/django-generic-notifications/tree/main/example/notifications/admin.py) that you can copy into your project for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Advanced Usage

### Required channels

Make certain channels mandatory for critical notifications:

```python
from generic_notifications.channels import EmailChannel

@register
class SecurityAlert(NotificationType):
    key = "security_alert"
    name = "Security Alerts"
    description = "Important security notifications"
    required_channels = [EmailChannel]  # Cannot be disabled
```

### Querying notifications

```python
from generic_notifications.channels import WebsiteChannel
from generic_notifications.models import Notification
from generic_notifications.lib import get_unread_count, get_notifications, mark_notifications_as_read

# Get unread count for a user
unread_count = get_unread_count(user=user, channel=WebsiteChannel)

# Get unread notifications for a user
unread_notifications = get_notifications(user=user, channel=WebsiteChannel, unread_only=True)

# Get notifications by channel
website_notifications = Notification.objects.for_channel(WebsiteChannel)

# Mark as read
notification = website_notifications.first()
notification.mark_as_read()

# Mark all as read
mark_notifications_as_read(user=user)
```

### Notification grouping

Prevent notification spam by grouping similar notifications together. Instead of creating multiple "You received a comment" notifications, you can update an existing notification to say "You received 3 comments".

```python
@register
class CommentNotification(NotificationType):
    key = "comment"
    name = "Comment Notifications"
    description = "When someone comments on your posts"

    @classmethod
    def should_save(cls, notification):
        # Look for existing unread notification with same actor and target
        existing = Notification.objects.filter(
            recipient=notification.recipient,
            notification_type=notification.notification_type,
            actor=notification.actor,
            content_type_id=notification.content_type_id,
            object_id=notification.object_id,
            read__isnull=True,
        ).first()

        if existing:
            # Update count in metadata
            count = existing.metadata.get("count", 1)
            existing.metadata["count"] = count + 1
            existing.save()
            return False  # Don't create new notification

        # First notification of this type, so it should be saved
        return True

    def get_text(self, notification):
        count = notification.metadata.get("count", 1)
        actor_name = notification.actor.get_full_name()

        if count == 1:
            return f"{actor_name} commented on your post"
        else:
            return f"{actor_name} left {count} comments on your post"
```

The `should_save` method is called before saving each notification. Return `False` to prevent creating a new notification and instead update an existing one. This gives you complete control over grouping logic - you might group by time windows, actors, targets, or any other criteria.

## Performance Considerations

### Accessing `notification.target`

The `target` field is a GenericForeignKey that can point to any Django model instance. While convenient, accessing targets requires careful consideration for performance.

When using Django 5.0+, this library automatically includes `.prefetch_related("target")` when using the standard query methods. This efficiently fetches target objects, but only the *direct* targets - accessing relationships *through* the target will still cause additional queries. 

*On Django 4.2, you'll need to manually deal with prefetching the `target` relationship.*

Consider this problematic example that will cause N+1 queries:

```python
class Article(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    text = models.TextField()


class Comment(models.Model):
    article = models.ForeignKey(Article, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    comment_text = models.TextField()


@register
class CommentNotificationType(NotificationType):
    key = "comment_notification"
    name = "Comments"
    description = "You received a comment"

    def get_text(self, notification):
        actor_name = notification.actor.full_name
        article = notification.target.article
        comment_text = notification.target.comment_text
        
        # This causes an extra query per notification!
        return f'{actor_name} commented on your article "{article.title}": "{comment_text}"'
```

When displaying a list of 10 notifications, this will execute:

- 1 query for the notifications
- 1 query for the target comments (Django 5.0+ only, automatically prefetched)
- 10 queries for the articles (N+1 problem!)

#### Solution 1: store data in the notification

The simplest approach is to store the needed data directly in the notification:

```python
send_notification(
    recipient=article.author,
    notification_type=CommentNotificationType,
    actor=commenter,
    target=comment,
    subject=f"New comment on {article.title}",
    text=f'{commenter.full_name} commented on your article "{article.title}": "{comment.comment_text}"',
    url=article.get_absolute_url()
)
```

However, this only works if you donâ€™t need to dynamically generate the text - for example to make sure the text is always up to date, or to deal with internationalization.

#### Solution 2: prefetch deeper relationships

If you must access relationships through the target, you can prefetch them:

```python
# On Django 5.0+ the library already prefetches targets, 
# but you need to add deeper relationships yourself
notifications = get_notifications(user).prefetch_related(
    "target__article"  # This prevents the N+1 problem
)
```

**Note**: This approach has limitations:
- You need to know the target's type and relationships in advance
- It won't work efficiently with heterogeneous targets (different model types)
- Each additional relationship level requires explicit prefetching

#### For best performance

1. If possible, store all display data directly in the notification (subject, text, url)
2. If you need dynamic text, prefer accessing only direct fields on the target
3. Otherwise, make sure you prefetch the right relationships

### Non-blocking email sending

The email channel (EmailChannel) will send real-time emails using Djangoâ€™s built-in `send_mail` method. This is a blocking function call, meaning that while a connection with the SMTP server is made and the email is sent off, the process thatâ€™s sending the notification has to wait. This is not ideal, but easily solved by using something like [django-mailer](https://github.com/pinax/django-mailer/), which provides a queueing backend for `send_mail`. This means that sending email is no longer a blocking action.

## Multilingual Notifications

For applications that support multiple languages, you have two main approaches to handle translatable notification content.

### Approach 1: store parameters per language in metadata

Store translated parameters for each language in the `metadata` field and use Django's translation system in `get_text()`:

```python
from django.utils.translation import gettext as _, get_language

@register
class CommentNotificationType(NotificationType):
    key = "comment"
    name = "Comments"
    description = "When someone comments on your content"

    def get_text(self, notification):
        current_lang = get_language()
        # Get parameters for current language, fallback to English
        lang_params = notification.metadata.get(current_lang, notification.metadata.get("en", {}))
        
        return _("%(commenter_name)s commented on %(page_title)s") % lang_params

# When creating the notification
from django.conf import settings
from django.utils.translation import activate, get_language

def create_multilingual_notification(recipient, commenter, page):
    current_lang = get_language()
    multilingual_metadata = {}
    
    # Store parameters for each language
    for lang_code, _ in settings.LANGUAGES:
        activate(lang_code)
        multilingual_metadata[lang_code] = {
            "commenter_name": commenter.get_full_name(),
            "page_title": page.get_title(),  # Assumes this returns translated title
        }
    
    activate(current_lang)  # Restore original language
    
    send_notification(
        recipient=recipient,
        notification_type=CommentNotificationType,
        actor=commenter,
        target=page,
        metadata=multilingual_metadata
    )
```

**Pros**: Best query performance  
**Cons**: Parameters are "frozen" when notification is created, more database storage needed

### Approach 2: dynamic translation via target

Use the `target` relationship to access current translated data:

```python
@register
class CommentNotificationType(NotificationType):
    key = "comment"
    name = "Comments"
    description = "When someone comments on your content"

    def get_text(self, notification):
        from django.utils.translation import gettext as _
        
        # Access current language data from the target
        if notification.target:
            return _("%(commenter)s commented on %(page_title)s") % {
                "commenter": notification.actor.get_full_name(),
                "page_title": notification.target.get_title()  # Assumes this returns translated title
            }
        return self.description

# Usage is simple - just send the notification
send_notification(
    recipient=page.author,
    notification_type=CommentNotificationType,
    actor=commenter,
    target=page
)
```

**Pros**: Always current data, minimal storage, simpler code  
**Cons**: Requires proper prefetching for performance

### Performance considerations

| Approach | Storage Overhead | Query Performance | Translation Freshness |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Approach 1 | Moderate | Excellent | Frozen when created |
| Approach 2 | None | Good (with prefetching) | Always current |

- Use **approach 1** if you have performance-critical displays and can accept that text is frozen when the notification is created
- Use **approach 2** if you need always-current data
