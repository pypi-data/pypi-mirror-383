[![Publish Package to PyPI](https://github.com/AlessioNar/op_cellar/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AlessioNar/op_cellar/actions/workflows/publish.yml)

## 1. Introduction

The `tulit` package provides utilities to work with legal data in a way that legal informatics practitioners can focus on adding value. 

## 2. Getting started

Full documentation is available at [https://tulit-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](https://tulit-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

### 2.1 Installation

To install the `tulit` package, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install tulit
```

or using poetry:

```bash
poetry add tulit
```

## 3. Database Structure

The `tulit` package uses a hierarchical database structure to organize legal documents from various sources.

### 3.1 Directory Organization

The database is located **outside the package** at `../database/` to keep production data separate from the codebase:

```
database/
├── sources/           # Raw downloaded documents
│   ├── eu/
│   │   └── eurlex/
│   │       ├── formex/              # FORMEX XML files from Cellar
│   │       ├── akn/                 # Akoma Ntoso XML files
│   │       ├── regulations/html/    # HTML regulations
│   │       └── commission_proposals/ # Commission proposals
│   ├── member_states/
│   │   ├── portugal/dre/            # Portuguese legal gazette
│   │   ├── italy/normattiva/        # Italian Normattiva
│   │   ├── luxembourg/legilux/      # Luxembourg Legilux
│   │   ├── france/legifrance/       # French Legifrance
│   │   ├── finland/finlex/          # Finnish Finlex
│   │   ├── malta/moj/               # Malta Ministry of Justice
│   │   ├── germany/gesetze/         # German legislation
│   │   └── spain/boe/               # Spanish Official Gazette
│   └── regional_authorities/
│       └── italy/veneto/            # Veneto regional laws
├── results/           # Parsed JSON documents
│   ├── eu/
│   │   ├── proposals/               # Parsed proposals
│   │   ├── formex/                  # Parsed FORMEX
│   │   ├── html/                    # Parsed regulations
│   │   └── akn/                     # Parsed AKN
│   ├── member_states/               # Parsed national docs
│   └── regional/                    # Parsed regional docs
└── logs/              # Download and processing logs
```

### 3.2 Hierarchical Principle

The structure follows a **jurisdictional hierarchy**:

1. **EU Level** (`eu/`): European Union institutions and bodies
2. **Member State Level** (`member_states/`): National governments
3. **Regional Level** (`regional_authorities/`): Sub-national authorities

### 3.3 Data Collection and Processing

#### Collecting Documents

Download legal documents from various sources:

```bash
python run_all_clients.py
```

This script:
- Creates the database directory structure automatically
- Downloads documents from EU and national legal information systems
- Saves raw documents to `database/sources/`
- Logs operations to `database/logs/`

#### Parsing Documents

Process downloaded documents into structured JSON:

```bash
python run_all_parsers.py
```

This script:
- Reads documents from `database/sources/`
- Parses using appropriate parsers (HTML, FORMEX, AKN)
- Saves structured JSON to `database/results/`
- Maintains the same hierarchical organization

### 3.4 Separation of Concerns

- **`sources/`**: Raw documents as downloaded (immutable, not committed to git)
- **`results/`**: Parsed/structured documents (reproducible, not committed to git)
- **`tests/data/`**: Sample fixtures for unit tests (committed to git)

This separation ensures:
- Data preservation
- Reproducibility
- Clear data lineage
- Version control hygiene (production data stays local)

## 4. Standards and Formats

### 4.1 Supported Standards

The `tulit` package is designed to work with existing standards and structured formats in the legal informatics domain. The following are some of the standards and formats that the package supports:

* [LegalDocML (Akoma Ntoso)](https://groups.oasis-open.org/communities/tc-community-home2?CommunityKey=3425f20f-b704-4076-9fab-018dc7d3efbe)
* [FORMEX](https://op.europa.eu/documents/3938058/5910419/formex_manual_on_screen_version.html)

### 4.2 Future Standards

Further standards and formats will be added in the future such as:

* [LegalHTML](https://art.uniroma2.it/legalhtml/)
* [NormeInRete](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-legal-information/article/abs/norme-in-rete-project-standards-and-tools-for-italian-legislation/483BA5BF2EC4E9DD6636E761FE84AE15)
