"""
This module provides various methods to form current inputs.
You can access them through ``braintools.input.XXX``.

The module now supports two APIs:
1. **Composable API (recommended)**: Object-oriented API that allows combining inputs
2. **Functional API**: Traditional function-based API for backward compatibility

Composable API Example:
-----------------------
>>> import brainunit as u
>>> from braintools.input import Ramp, Sinusoidal
>>> ramp = Ramp(0, 1, 500 * u.ms)
>>> sine = Sinusoidal(0.5, 10 * u.Hz, 500 * u.ms)
>>> combined = ramp + sine  # Combine inputs
>>> scaled = combined.scale(0.5)  # Transform result
>>> array = scaled()  # Generate the array

Functional API Example:
-----------------------
>>> import brainunit as u
>>> from braintools.input import ramp, sinusoidal
>>> ramp_signal = ramp(0, 1, 500 * u.ms)
>>> sine_signal = sinusoidal(0.5, 10 * u.Hz, 500 * u.ms)
>>> combined = ramp_signal + sine_signal  # Simple array addition

Legacy Notice:
----------------
Legacy names ending with `Input`/`_input` remain available as deprecated aliases and emit `DeprecationWarning`.
