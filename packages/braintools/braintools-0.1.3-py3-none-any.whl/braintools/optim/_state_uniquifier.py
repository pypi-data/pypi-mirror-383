class UniqueStateManager:
    """
    A class to manage unique State objects in a PyTree structure.

    This class:
    1. Flattens a PyTree with State leaves to (path, leaf) pairs
    2. Removes duplicate State objects based on their id()
    3. Supports recovering the unique states back to a PyTree structure

    Example usage:
        >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
        >>> from brainstate import ParamState
        >>>
        >>> # Create a pytree with some duplicate State objects
        >>> state1 = ParamState(jnp.ones((2, 3)))
        >>> state2 = ParamState(jnp.zeros((3, 4)))
        >>>
        >>> pytree = {
        ...     'layer1': {'weight': state1, 'bias': state2},
        ...     'layer2': {'weight': state1, 'bias': ParamState(jnp.ones((4,)))}  # state1 is duplicate
        ... }
        >>>
        >>> # Create manager and process the pytree
        >>> manager = UniqueStateManager()
        >>> unique_pytree = manager.make_unique(pytree)
        >>>
        >>> # The duplicate state1 in layer2.weight will be removed
        >>> print(len(manager.flattened_states))  # Will be 3 instead of 4
        >>>
        >>> # Recover to pytree structure
        >>> recovered = manager.to_pytree()
