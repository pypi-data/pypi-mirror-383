) -> jax.Array:
    r"""Compute cosine similarity between samples in X and Y.

    Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors,
    providing a metric of similarity that is independent of vector magnitude.
    It ranges from -1 (opposite directions) to 1 (same direction).

    The cosine similarity is defined as:

    .. math::

        \text{similarity} = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{||\mathbf{A}|| ||\mathbf{B}||}

    where :math:`\mathbf{A}` and :math:`\mathbf{B}` are vectors, and :math:`||\cdot||`
    denotes the L2 norm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : brainstate.typing.ArrayLike
        Input array with shape ``(n_samples_X, n_features)``. Each row
        represents a sample/vector.
    Y : brainstate.typing.ArrayLike, optional
        Input array with shape ``(n_samples_Y, n_features)``. If None,
        computes pairwise similarities within X.
    eps : float, default=1e-8
        Small epsilon value to avoid division by zero when computing norms.

    Returns
    -------
    jax.Array
        Cosine similarity matrix:
        
        - If Y is provided: shape ``(n_samples_X, n_samples_Y)``
        - If Y is None: shape ``(n_samples_X, n_samples_X)``
        
        Element (i,j) represents the cosine similarity between sample i
        from X and sample j from Y (or X if Y is None).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
    >>> import braintools as braintools
    >>> # Create sample vectors
    >>> X = jnp.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]])
    >>> # Compute pairwise similarities
    >>> sim_matrix = braintools.metric.cosine_similarity(X)
    >>> print(sim_matrix)
    [[1.         0.         0.70710677]
     [0.         1.         0.70710677]
     [0.70710677 0.70710677 1.        ]]
    >>> 
    >>> # Compare with different set
    >>> Y = jnp.array([[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]])
    >>> cross_sim = braintools.metric.cosine_similarity(X, Y)
    >>> print(cross_sim.shape)
    (3, 2)

    Notes
    -----
    The function handles zero vectors by adding a small epsilon to avoid
    division by zero. NaN values in the result are replaced with 0.
