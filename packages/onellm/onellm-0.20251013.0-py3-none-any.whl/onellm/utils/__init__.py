Utility functions and classes for OneLLM.

This module provides various utility functions and classes used throughout the OneLLM
package to handle common tasks such as:
- Asynchronous retry mechanisms for API calls
- Streaming response handling
- Error management for streaming operations

These utilities help ensure robust API interactions and proper handling of
streaming responses when working with different LLM providers.
