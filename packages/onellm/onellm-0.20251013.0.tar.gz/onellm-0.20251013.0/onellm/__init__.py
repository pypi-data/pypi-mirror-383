OneLLM: A lightweight, provider-agnostic Python library that offers a unified interface
for interacting with large language models (LLMs) from various providers.

This module serves as the main entry point for the OneLLM library, exposing all
public APIs and functionality to users. It provides a consistent interface for working
with different LLM providers while maintaining compatibility with the OpenAI API format.

    Initialize the global semantic cache.

    The cache reduces API costs and improves response times by intelligently caching
    LLM responses using a hybrid approach: instant hash-based exact matching combined
    with semantic similarity search for near-duplicate queries.

    For streaming requests, cached responses are returned as simulated streams, chunked
    naturally to maintain the streaming UX while saving API costs.

    Args:
        max_entries: Maximum number of cache entries before LRU eviction (default: 1000)
        p: Similarity threshold for semantic matching (default: 0.95)
        hash_only: Disable semantic matching, use only hash-based exact matches (default: False)
        stream_chunk_strategy: How to chunk cached streaming responses (default: "words")
            - "words": Split by words (most natural for general text)
            - "sentences": Split by sentences (periods, newlines, etc.)
            - "paragraphs": Split by paragraphs (double newlines)
            - "characters": Split by character count (precise control)
        stream_chunk_length: Number of strategy units per chunk (default: 8)
            - For "words": 8 words per chunk (~40 chars)
            - For "sentences": 8 sentences per chunk
            - For "paragraphs": 8 paragraphs per chunk
            - For "characters": 8 characters per chunk
        ttl: Time-to-live in seconds for cache entries (default: 86400, 1 day)
            - Entries older than TTL are automatically expired on access
            - Accessing an entry refreshes its TTL

    Example:
        >>> import onellm
        >>> onellm.init_cache()  # Enable with defaults
        >>> onellm.init_cache(p=0.9)  # More aggressive matching
        >>> onellm.init_cache(stream_chunk_strategy="sentences", stream_chunk_length=2)
        >>> onellm.init_cache(ttl=3600)  # 1 hour TTL
