## Why Blits? [â€‹](#why-blits){.header-anchor aria-label="Permalink to \"Why Blits?\""} {#why-blits tabindex="-1"}

You may be wondering where the name Blits comes from.

Firstly, it\'s short, memorable and just has a nice ring to it.

\"Blits\" is a Dutch word (a significant portion of the Lightning Open
Source team is based in the Netherlands). It means *flashy* and it\'s
often used for things that are *great* or *cool*.

Finally, it\'s a nerdy reference to the computer term \"Bit Blits\"
commonly used in graphics processing, for rapidly moving a block of data
into memory - quite similar to what Lightning is doing ðŸ™‚
