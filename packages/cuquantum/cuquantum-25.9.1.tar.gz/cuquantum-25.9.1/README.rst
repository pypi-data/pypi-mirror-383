cuQuantum SDK: A High-Performance Library for Accelerating Quantum Computing Simulations
****************************************************************************************

`NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuquantum-sdk>`_ is a set of high-performance libraries and tools for accelerating 
quantum computing simulations at both the circuit and device level by orders of magnitude. It consists of three major components:

* cuDensityMat: a high-performance library for quantum dynamics equation solvers
* cuStateVec: a high-performance library for state vector quantum simulators
* cuTensorNet: a high-performance library for tensor network computations

In addition to C APIs, cuQuantum also provides Python APIs via `cuQuantum Python`_.

Documentation
=============

Please refer to https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/index.html for the cuQuantum documentation.

Installation
============

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -v --no-cache-dir cuquantum

.. note::

   Starting cuQuantum 22.11, this package is a meta package pointing to ``cuquantum-cuXX``,
   where XX is the CUDA major version (currently CUDA 12 & 13 are supported).
   The meta package will attempt to infer and install the correct ``-cuXX`` wheel. 
   The auto-detection mechanism is not guaranteed to work in certain environments, and users are encouraged to install the new wheels that
   come *with* the ``-cuXX`` suffix.

   The argument ``--no-cache-dir`` is required for pip 23.1+. It forces pip to execute the
   auto-detection logic.

.. note::

   To use cuQuantum's Python APIs, please directly install `cuQuantum Python`_.
