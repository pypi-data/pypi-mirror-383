        Retrieves all unique document URLs (e.g., PDFs) for a specific Manufacturer Communication Number
        associated with a given VIN. This involves a multi-step process:
        1. Decodes the VIN to get basic vehicle information (Make, Model, Model Year).
        2. Searches for corresponding Vehicle IDs using the obtained Make, Model, and Model Year.
        3. For each identified Vehicle ID, retrieves its detailed safety issues, specifically
           Manufacturer Communications.
        4. Filters these communications to find entries matching the provided Manufacturer
           Communication Number.
        5. For each matching communication, it performs a *second* API call to `safetyIssues/byNhtsaId`
           to get the full details of that specific NHTSA ID, which includes the direct PDF URLs
           within `associatedDocuments`.

        Returns:
            Set[str]: A set of unique URLs to the associated documents (e.g., PDF files).
                      Returns an empty set if no matching communications or documents are found,
                      or if an error occurs.
