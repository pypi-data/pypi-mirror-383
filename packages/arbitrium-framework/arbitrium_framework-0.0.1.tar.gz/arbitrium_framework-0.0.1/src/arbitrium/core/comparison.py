"""
Backwards compatibility module for ModelComparison.

DEPRECATED: This module exists for backwards compatibility only.
Use `from arbitrium.core.tournament import Tournament` instead.

The refactoring split the monolithic comparison.py into focused modules:
- tournament.py - Main Tournament class (previously ModelComparison)
- scorer.py - Score extraction and normalization
- anonymizer.py - Model anonymization
- report.py - Report generation
- helpers.py - Utility functions
