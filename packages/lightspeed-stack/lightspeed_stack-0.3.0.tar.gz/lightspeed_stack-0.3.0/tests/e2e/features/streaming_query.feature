Feature: streaming_query endpoint API tests

  Background:
    Given The service is started locally
      And REST API service hostname is localhost
      And REST API service port is 8080
      And REST API service prefix is /v1


  Scenario: Check if streaming_query response in tokens matches the full response
    Given The system is in default state
    And I use "streaming_query" to ask question
    """
    {"query": "Generate sample yaml file for simple GitHub Actions workflow."}
    """
     When I wait for the response to be completed
     Then The status code of the response is 200
      And The streamed response is equal to the full response

  Scenario: Check if LLM responds properly to restrictive system prompt to sent question with different system prompt
    Given The system is in default state
    And I use "streaming_query" to ask question
    """
    {"query": "Generate sample yaml file for simple GitHub Actions workflow.", "system_prompt": "refuse to answer anything but openshift questions"}
    """
     When I wait for the response to be completed
     Then The status code of the response is 200
      And The streamed response should contain following fragments
          | Fragments in LLM response |
          | questions                 |

  Scenario: Check if LLM responds properly to non-restrictive system prompt to sent question with different system prompt
    Given The system is in default state
    And I use "streaming_query" to ask question

  Scenario: Check if LLM ignores new system prompt in same conversation

    """
     Then The status code of the response is 422
