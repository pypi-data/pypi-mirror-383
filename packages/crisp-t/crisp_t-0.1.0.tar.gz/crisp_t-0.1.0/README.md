**TL;DR** üöÄ *CRISP-T is a qualitative research method and a toolkit to perform textual (e.g. topic modelling) and numeric (e.g. decision trees) analysis of mixed datasets for computational triangulation and sense-making using large language models.*

Qualitative research involves the collection and analysis of textual data, such as interview transcripts, open-ended survey responses, and field notes. It is often used in social sciences, humanities, and health research to explore complex phenomena and understand human experiences. In addition to textual data, qualitative researchers may also collect quantitative data, such as survey responses or demographic information, to complement their qualitative findings. Additionally, qualitative researchers use external data sources, such as census data or social media data, to provide context and triangulate their findings. Qualitative research is often characterized by its inductive approach, where researchers aim to generate theories or concepts from the data rather than testing pre-existing hypotheses. It emphasizes the importance of data-driven analysis and theory development.

CRISP-T is a method and corresponding open-source tool set to integrate **textual data** (as a list of documents) and **numeric data** (as Pandas DataFrame) into structured classes that retain **metadata** from various analytical processes, such as **topic modeling** and **decision trees**. Researchers, with or without GenAI assistance, can define relationships between textual and numerical datasets based on their chosen **theoretical lens**.  A final analytical phase ensures that proposed relationships actually hold true. [See Demo](/notes/DEMO.md).

An MCP server exposes all functionality as tools, resources, and prompts, enabling integration with AI agent platforms such as Claude desktop, VSCODE and other MCP-compatible clients.

## Installation

```bash
pip install crisp-t
```

Include machine learning features for numeric data analysis:
```bash
pip install crisp-t[ml]
```

## Command Line Scripts

CRISP-T now provides three main command-line scripts:

- `crisp` ‚Äî Main CLI for qualitative triangulation and analysis (see below)
- `crispviz` ‚Äî Visualization CLI for corpus data (word frequencies, topic charts, wordclouds, etc.)
- `crispt` ‚Äî Corpus manipulation CLI (create, edit, query, and manage corpus objects)
- `crisp-mcp` ‚Äî Starts the MCP server for AI integration (see MCP section below)

All scripts are installed as entry points and can be run directly from the command line after installation.

### crisp (Analytical CLI)

```bash
crisp [OPTIONS]
```

#### Input/Output Options

- `--inp, -i PATH`: Load an existing corpus from a folder containing `corpus.json` (and optional `corpus_df.csv`)
- `--out, -o PATH`: When saving the corpus, provide a folder path; the CLI writes `corpus.json` (and `corpus_df.csv` if available) into that folder. When saving analysis results (topics, sentiment, etc.), this acts as a base path: files are written with suffixes, e.g., `results_topics.json`.
- `--unstructured, -t TEXT`: Text CSV column(s) to analyze/compare (can be used multiple times). This is useful when you have free-form text data in a DataFrame. If this is provided, those columns are used as documents.
- `--ignore TEXT`: Comma-separated words to ignore during ingestion (applies to `--source/--sources`)

#### Analysis Options

- `--codedict`: Generate qualitative coding dictionary
- `--topics`: Generate topic model using LDA
- `--assign`: Assign documents to topics
- `--cat`: List categories of entire corpus or individual documents
- `--summary`: Generate extractive text summary
- `--sentiment`: Generate sentiment scores using VADER
- `--sentence`: Generate sentence-level scores when applicable
- `--nlp`: Generate all NLP reports (combines above text analyses)
- `--nnet`, `--cls`, `--knn`, `--kmeans`, `--cart`, `--pca`, `--regression`, `--ml`: Machine learning and clustering options (requires `crisp-t[ml]`)
  - `--regression`: Perform linear or logistic regression (automatically detects binary outcomes for logistic regression)
- `--visualize`: Generate visualizations (word clouds, topic charts, etc.)
- `--num, -n INTEGER`: Number parameter (clusters, topics, epochs, etc.) - default: 3
- `--rec, -r INTEGER`: Record parameter (top N results, recommendations) - default: 3
- `--filters, -f TEXT`: Filters to apply as `key=value` (can be used multiple times); keeps only documents where `document.metadata[key] == value`. Invalid formats raise an error.
- `--verbose, -v`: Print verbose messages for debugging

#### Data Sources

- `--source, -s PATH|URL`: Read source data from a directory (reads .txt and .pdf) or from a URL
- `--sources PATH|URL`: Provide multiple sources; can be used multiple times

### crispviz (Visualization CLI)

```bash
crispviz [OPTIONS]
```

- `--inp, --source, --sources`: Input corpus or sources
- `--out`: Output directory for PNG images
- Visualization flags: `--freq`, `--by-topic`, `--wordcloud`, `--top-terms`, `--corr-heatmap`
- Optional params: `--bins`, `--top-n`, `--columns`

### crispt (Corpus Manipulation CLI)

```bash
crispt [OPTIONS]
```

- `--id`, `--name`, `--description`: Corpus metadata
- `--doc`: Add document as `id|name|text` or `id|text` (repeatable)
- `--remove-doc`: Remove document by ID (repeatable)
- `--meta`: Add/update corpus metadata as `key=value` (repeatable)
- `--add-rel`: Add relationship as `first|second|relation` (repeatable)
- `--clear-rel`: Clear all relationships
- `--out`: Save corpus to folder/file as `corpus.json`
- `--inp`: Load corpus from folder/file containing `corpus.json`
- Query options:
	- `--df-cols`: Print DataFrame column names
	- `--df-row-count`: Print DataFrame row count
	- `--df-row INDEX`: Print DataFrame row by index
	- `--doc-ids`: Print all document IDs
	- `--doc-id ID`: Print document by ID
	- `--relationships`: Print all relationships
	- `--relationships-for-keyword KEYWORD`: Print relationships involving a keyword

### [Example Usage](/notes/DEMO.md)

When saving the corpus via `--out`, the CLI writes `corpus.json` (and `corpus_df.csv` if present) into the specified folder. If you pass a file path, only its parent directory is used for writing `corpus.json`.

## MCP Server

CRISP-T provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes all functionality as tools, resources, and prompts. This enables integration with AI assistants and other MCP-compatible clients.

## Role of CRISP-T in research and practice

The workflow enables AI assistants to help conduct comprehensive analyses by combining text analytics, machine learning, and triangulation of qualitative-quantitative findings.

For example, in market research, a company collects:
- **Textual** feedback from customer support interactions.
- **Numerical** data on customer retention and sales performance.
Using this framework, business analysts can investigate how recurring concerns in feedback correspond to measurable business outcomes.
