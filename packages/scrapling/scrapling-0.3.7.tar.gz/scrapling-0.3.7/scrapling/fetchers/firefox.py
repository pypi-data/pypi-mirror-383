        Opens up a browser and do your request based on your chosen options below.

        :param url: Target url.
        :param headless: Run the browser in headless/hidden (default), or headful/visible mode.
        :param block_images: Prevent the loading of images through Firefox preferences.
            This can help save your proxy usage but be careful with this option as it makes some websites never finish loading.
        :param disable_resources: Drop requests of unnecessary resources for a speed boost. It depends, but it made requests ~25% faster in my tests for some websites.
            Requests dropped are of type `font`, `image`, `media`, `beacon`, `object`, `imageset`, `texttrack`, `websocket`, `csp_report`, and `stylesheet`.
            This can help save your proxy usage but be careful with this option as it makes some websites never finish loading.
        :param block_webrtc: Blocks WebRTC entirely.
        :param cookies: Set cookies for the next request.
        :param addons: List of Firefox addons to use. Must be paths to extracted addons.
        :param humanize: Humanize the cursor movement. Takes either True or the MAX duration in seconds of the cursor movement. The cursor typically takes up to 1.5 seconds to move across the window.
        :param solve_cloudflare: Solves all types of the Cloudflare's Turnstile/Interstitial challenges before returning the response to you.
        :param allow_webgl: Enabled by default. Disabling WebGL is not recommended as many WAFs now check if WebGL is enabled.
        :param network_idle: Wait for the page until there are no network connections for at least 500 ms.
        :param load_dom: Enabled by default, wait for all JavaScript on page(s) to fully load and execute.
        :param disable_ads: Disabled by default, this installs the `uBlock Origin` addon on the browser if enabled.
        :param os_randomize: If enabled, Scrapling will randomize the OS fingerprints used. The default is Scrapling matching the fingerprints with the current OS.
        :param wait: The time (milliseconds) the fetcher will wait after everything finishes before closing the page and returning the ` Response ` object.
        :param timeout: The timeout in milliseconds that is used in all operations and waits through the page. The default is 30,000
        :param page_action: Added for automation. A function that takes the `page` object and does the automation you need.
        :param wait_selector: Wait for a specific CSS selector to be in a specific state.
        :param init_script: An absolute path to a JavaScript file to be executed on page creation with this request.
