        Note: This is best suitable for high protection levels. It's slower than the other tools.
        Note: If the `css_selector` resolves to more than one element, all the elements will be returned.

        :param url: The URL to request.
        :param extraction_type: The type of content to extract from the page. Defaults to "markdown". Options are:
            - Markdown will convert the page content to Markdown format.
            - HTML will return the raw HTML content of the page.
            - Text will return the text content of the page.
        :param css_selector: CSS selector to extract the content from the page. If main_content_only is True, then it will be executed on the main content of the page. Defaults to None.
        :param main_content_only: Whether to extract only the main content of the page. Defaults to True. The main content here is the data inside the `<body>` tag.
        :param headless: Run the browser in headless/hidden (default), or headful/visible mode.
        :param block_images: Prevent the loading of images through Firefox preferences.
            This can help save your proxy usage but be careful with this option as it makes some websites never finish loading.
        :param disable_resources: Drop requests of unnecessary resources for a speed boost. It depends, but it made requests ~25% faster in my tests for some websites.
            Requests dropped are of type `font`, `image`, `media`, `beacon`, `object`, `imageset`, `texttrack`, `websocket`, `csp_report`, and `stylesheet`.
            This can help save your proxy usage but be careful with this option as it makes some websites never finish loading.
        :param block_webrtc: Blocks WebRTC entirely.
        :param cookies: Set cookies for the next request.
        :param addons: List of Firefox addons to use. Must be paths to extracted addons.
        :param humanize: Humanize the cursor movement. Takes either True or the MAX duration in seconds of the cursor movement. The cursor typically takes up to 1.5 seconds to move across the window.
        :param solve_cloudflare: Solves all types of the Cloudflare's Turnstile/Interstitial challenges before returning the response to you.
        :param allow_webgl: Enabled by default. Disabling WebGL is not recommended as many WAFs now check if WebGL is enabled.
        :param network_idle: Wait for the page until there are no network connections for at least 500 ms.
        :param disable_ads: Disabled by default, this installs the `uBlock Origin` addon on the browser if enabled.
        :param os_randomize: If enabled, Scrapling will randomize the OS fingerprints used. The default is Scrapling matching the fingerprints with the current OS.
        :param wait: The time (milliseconds) the fetcher will wait after everything finishes before closing the page and returning the ` Response ` object.
        :param timeout: The timeout in milliseconds that is used in all operations and waits through the page. The default is 30,000
        :param wait_selector: Wait for a specific CSS selector to be in a specific state.
        :param geoip: Recommended to use with proxies; Automatically use IP's longitude, latitude, timezone, country, locale, and spoof the WebRTC IP address.
            It will also calculate and spoof the browser's language based on the distribution of language speakers in the target region.
        :param wait_selector_state: The state to wait for the selector given with `wait_selector`. The default state is `attached`.
        :param google_search: Enabled by default, Scrapling will set the referer header to be as if this request came from a Google search of this website's domain name.
        :param extra_headers: A dictionary of extra headers to add to the request. _The referer set by the `google_search` argument takes priority over the referer set here if used together._
        :param proxy: The proxy to be used with requests, it can be a string or a dictionary with the keys 'server', 'username', and 'password' only.
        :param additional_args: Additional arguments to be passed to Camoufox as additional settings, and it takes higher priority than Scrapling's settings.
