## About

A4X-Orchestration is a Python library that abstracts the process of configuring a workflow to be
agnostic of the workflow management system (WMS) used. When using A4X-Orchestration, users can configure their
workflow for any supported WMS by performing the following steps:
1. Define workflow tasks using A4X-Orchestration
2. Combine workflow tasks into a workflow represented as a DAG using A4X-Orchestration
3. Call A4X-Orchestration's `Workflow.convert` method to get a WMS-specific representation of the workflow
4. If desired, perform additional, WMS-specific configuration using the output of `Workflow.convert`

Support for different WMSes is (for the most part) not built directly into A4X-Orchestration. Instead, A4X-Orchestration
uses entry point-based plugins to support different WMSes. So, to use A4X-Orchestration with a specific
WMS, users must install the plugin for that WMS. Below is an unofficial list of all supported
WMSes and how to install them:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Plugin Name</th>
        <th>Workflow Management System or<br>Resource Manager</th>
        <th>Install Command</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A4X Pegasus WMS</td>
        <td><a href="https://pegasus.isi.edu/">Pegasus</a></td>
        <td><code>pip install a4x-pegasus-wms</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Flux Plugin</th>
        <td><a href="https://flux-framework.org/">Flux</a></th>
        <td>N.A. (builtin)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Dependencies

A4X-Orchestration has the following dependencies:
* Python 3.7 or newer
* [networkx](https://networkx.org/)
* [ruamel.yaml](https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/)
* [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)
* [importlib-metadata](https://pypi.org/project/importlib-metadata/) (only for Python versions less than 3.10)

Note that most users should not have to install these manually. Most Python package managers (e.g., `pip`)
will automatically install all these dependencies (except Python itself) when you install A4X-Orchestration.

## Installation

There are two ways to install A4X-Orchestration: (1) with `pip` and (2) with Spack.

### (1) Pip

A4X-Orchestration can be installed like most other Python packages by simply running:
```bash
$ python3 -m pip install a4x-orchestration  # Note: this won't yet work
```

Additionally, users can install A4X-Orchestration from source by cloning the repository and running:
```bash
$ python3 -m pip install [-e] .
```

### (2) Spack

Support for building with Spack is not yet implemented.

## Using in Other Projects

A4X-Orchestration can be used by other projects once installed by simply importing it with:
```python
from a4x.orchestration import ...
```

To make A4X-Orchestration a dependency of your project, simply add the following to `pyproject.toml`
for a `pip`-installable project:
```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "a4x-orchestration"
]
```

Or add the following to `package.py` for a Spack-installable project:
```python
depends_on("a4x-orchestration")
```
