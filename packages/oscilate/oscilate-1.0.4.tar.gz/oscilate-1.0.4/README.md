# Nonlinear systems considered
The **OSCILATE** (Oscillators' nonlinear analysis through Symbolic ImplementATion of the mEthod of multiple scales) project allows the application of the **Method of Multiple Scales** (MMS) to a nonlinear equation or systems of $N$ coupled nonlinear equations of the form

$$
\begin{cases}
        \ddot{x}_0 + \omega_0^2 x_0 & = f_0(\boldsymbol{x}, \dot{\boldsymbol{x}}, \ddot{\boldsymbol{x}}, t), \\
        & \vdots \\
        \ddot{x}_{N-1} + \omega_{N-1}^2 x_{N-1} & = f_{N-1}(\boldsymbol{x}, \dot{\boldsymbol{x}}, \ddot{\boldsymbol{x}}, t).
        \end{cases}
$$

The $x_i(t)$ ($i=0,...,N-1$) are the oscillators' coordinates, 

$$
\boldsymbol{x}(t)^\intercal = [x_0(t), x_1(t), \cdots, x_{N-1}(t)]         
$$

is the vector containing all the oscillators' coordinates (the $^\intercal$ denotes the transpose),
$\omega_i$ are their natural frequencies,
$t$ is the time and
$\dot{(\bullet)} = \textrm{d}(\bullet)/\textrm{d}t$ denotes a time-derivative.
The $f_i$ are functions which can contain:

- **Weak linear terms** in $x_i$, $\dot{x}_i$, or $\ddot{x}_i$.
- **Weak linear coupling terms** involving $x_j$, $\dot{x}_j$, or $\ddot{x}_j$ with $j \neq i$.
- **Weak nonlinear terms**. Taylor expansions are performed to approximate nonlinear terms as *polynomial nonlinearities*.
- **Forcing terms**:

  - Can be hard (appearing at leading order) or weak (small).
  - Primarily *harmonic*, e.g., $F \cos(\omega t)$, where $F$ and $\omega$ are the forcing amplitude and frequency, respectively.
  - Modulated by any function (constant, linear, or nonlinear) to model *parametric* forcing (e.g., $x_i(t) F \cos(\omega t)$).

Internal resonance relations among oscillators can be specified in a second step by expressing the $\omega_i$ as a function of a reference frequency.
Detuning can also be introduced during this step.

# Overview


The package associated to the **OSCILATE** project is called ``oscilate``. 
It contains two modules:
- The `MMS` module is the MMS solver.
- The `sympy_functions` module contains additional functions that are not directly related to the MMS but which are used in `MMS`.


## Solver
`MMS` contains 3 main classes:
- `Dynamical_system` : the dynamical system considered
- `Multiple_scales_system` : the system obtained after applying the MMS to the dynamical system
- `Steady_state` : the MMS results evaluated at steady state and (if computed) the system's response and its stability. 

These classes are described in details in the [documentation](https://vinceECN.github.io/OSCILATE/).

## Examples
Application examples are proposed in the [documentation](https://vinceECN.github.io/OSCILATE/). They include
- The Duffing oscillator
- Coupled Duffing oscillators
- Coupled nonlinear oscillators with quadratic nonlinearities
- Parametrically excited oscillators
- Hard forcing of a Duffing oscillator
- Subharmonic response of 2 coupled centrifugal pendulum modes

## Outputs
Results are returned as sympy expressions.
They can be printed using $\LaTeX$ if the code is ran in an appropriate interactive Window. Here are possibilities:

* [VS Code's interactive Window](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py) 

* [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

* [Spyder's IPython consol](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/panes/ipythonconsole.html)
 
Sympy expressions can also be printed as unformatted $\LaTeX$ using 

```python
print(vlatex(the_expr))
```

Methods of `Steady_state` also allow to evaluate sympy results for given numerical values of system parameters and to plot them.
