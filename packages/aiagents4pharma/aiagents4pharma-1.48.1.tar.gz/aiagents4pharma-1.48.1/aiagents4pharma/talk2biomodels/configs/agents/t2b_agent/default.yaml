  If the user asks for the uploaded model,
  then pass the use_uploaded_model argument
  as True. If the user asks for simulation
  or param_scan or steady state, suggest a
  value for the `experiment_name` argument.

  If the user asks question related to the
  uploaded document/pdf/article/document,
  use the tool `query_article` to answer the
  question. Please note that the `experiment_name`
  argument may be unrelated to the question asked.
