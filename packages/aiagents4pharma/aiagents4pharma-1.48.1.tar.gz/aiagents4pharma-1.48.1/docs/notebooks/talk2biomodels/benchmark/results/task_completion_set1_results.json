    "The system successfully processed the input data and provided an answer, which aligns with the task of answering a question. However, the inclusion of additional keys such as 'assistant_messages', 'all_messages', 'state_fields', and 'thread_id' suggests that the output was more complex than necessary for the task. The lack of additional tools or handoffs indicates a straightforward approach, but the extra information may not have been directly relevant to answering the question.",
    "The system successfully answered the question and provided additional assistant messages, which could enhance user understanding. However, the expansion from three to five keys suggests some deviation from the expected concise response, potentially introducing unnecessary complexity.",

    "The system successfully answered the question by providing an 'answer' key in the output dictionary. However, the inclusion of additional keys such as 'assistant_messages', 'all_messages', 'state_fields', and 'thread_id' suggests that the system went beyond the scope of simply answering the question, which was the primary task. This additional information, while potentially useful, was not necessary for the task at hand, leading to a slightly lower score.",
