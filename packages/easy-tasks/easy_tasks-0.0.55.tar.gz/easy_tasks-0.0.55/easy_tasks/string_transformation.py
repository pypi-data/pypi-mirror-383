    """
    Remove specific lines from the source file in which this function is called.

    Lines can be specified either as a list (`linenos`) or as a range defined by
    `from_lineno` and `to_lineno`. All line numbers are one-based (i.e., line 1 is
    the first line of the file) and can optionally be relative to the call site.

    Args:
        linenos (list[int], optional): List of individual line numbers to remove.
            Ignored if both `from_lineno` and `to_lineno` are provided.
        from_lineno (int, optional): Start of the line range to remove (inclusive).
        to_lineno (int, optional): End of the line range to remove (inclusive).
        relative (bool, optional): If True, interpret all line numbers as relative
            to the line where this function is called. Defaults to False.
        backup (bool, optional): If True, create a `.bak` backup of the original file
            before writing changes. Defaults to True.
        dry_run (bool, optional): If True, do not modify the file and return the
            removed lines instead. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        dict[int, str] | None: If `dry_run` is True, returns a dictionary mapping
        each removed line number to its original content (sorted by line number).
        Otherwise, returns None.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If neither `linenos` nor a valid `from_lineno` and `to_lineno` range is provided.
        IndexError: If any specified line number is out of bounds.
        RuntimeError: If writing to the file fails.

    Notes:
        - This function modifies the file in-place unless `dry_run` is True.
        - Use with caution, especially if calling from within the file being modified.
