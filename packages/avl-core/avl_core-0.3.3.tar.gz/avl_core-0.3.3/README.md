# AVL - Apheleia Verification Library

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7%2B-blue)](https://www.python.org/)


AVL has been developed by experienced, industry professional verification engineers to provide a methodology \
and library of base classes for developing functional verification environments in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

AVL is built on the [CocoTB](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/) framework, but aims to combine the best elements of \
[UVM](https://accellera.org/community/uvm) in a more engineer friendly and efficient way.


## CocoTB 2.0

AVL now supports CocoTB2.0 https://docs.cocotb.org/en/development/upgrade-2.0.html. This was introduced in v0.3.0.

All older versions support v1.9.1 and will fail if run with CocoTB 2.0.

To upgrade follow the instructions given on the link above.

## üì¶ Installation

### Using `pip`
```sh
# Standard build
pip install avl-core

# Development build
pip install avl-core[dev]
```

### Install from Source
```sh
git clone https://github.com/projectapheleia/avl.git
cd avl

# Standard build
pip install .

# Development build
pip install .[dev]
```

Alternatively if you want to create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) rather than install globally a script is provided. This will install, with edit privileges to local virtual environment.

This script assumes you have  [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/verilator/), [GTKWave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) and [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) installed, so all examples and documentation will build out of the box.


```sh
git clone https://github.com/projectapheleia/avl.git
cd avl
source avl.sh
```

## üìñ Documentation

In order to build the documentation you must have installed the development build.

### Build from Source
```sh
cd docs
make html
<browser> build/html/index.html
```
## üèÉ Examples

In order to run all the examples you must have installed the development build.

To run all examples:

```sh
cd examples

# To run
make -j 8 sim

# To clean
make -j 8 clean
```

To run an individual example:

```sh
cd examples/THE EXAMPLE YOU WANT

# To run
make sim

# To clean
make clean
```

The examples use the [CocoTB Makefile](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/building.html) and default to [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/verilator/) with all waveforms generated. This can be modified using the standard CocoTB build system.
