# upgrade-py-direct-reqs

**Upgrade only direct dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` safely.**

A Python CLI tool that lets you review and upgrade **only direct dependencies** in a project‚Äôs `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`, while keeping your pinned versions up to date.

Developed by Miteshkumar N Raval with guidance and scripting assistance from coding agents.

## Test instructions 

### To run CLI tests with pytest:
``` 
 1. Ensure pytest is installed in your environment: pip install pytest

       pytest tests/test_cli.py
 3. Tests cover:
       - requirements.txt only
       - pyproject.toml only
       - conflicting dependencies in both files
       - empty requirements.txt
