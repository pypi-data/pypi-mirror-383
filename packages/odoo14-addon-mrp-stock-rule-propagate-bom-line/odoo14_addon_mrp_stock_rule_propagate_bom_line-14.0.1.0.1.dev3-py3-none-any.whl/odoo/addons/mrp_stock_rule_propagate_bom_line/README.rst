This module adds a `Propagate BOM Line` checkbox on stock rule.

When this checkbox is marked and pull rules are applied for kit products,
it will avoid grouping the stock moves of the same product if these stock
moves are originating from different kits (ie different BOM lines).

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Since version 15.0, Odoo propagates `bom_line_id` from the move to the procurement
in any case.

Therefore, if this module is to be migrated, it must provide the checkbox on the stock
rule to remove the propagation and allow merging of the moves.
