# Code Review Guidelines and Checklist

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for conducting effective code reviews within our development teams. Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality, sharing knowledge, and ensuring adherence to our coding standards.

## Code Review Process

- [ ] Pull request description includes context and rationale
- [ ] Breaking changes are clearly documented

### Review Timeline

- **Initial Review**: Within 24 hours of submission
- **Follow-up Reviews**: Within 4 hours of updates
- **Maximum Review Cycle**: 3 days from initial submission

## Code Review Checklist

### Functionality and Logic

**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Code accomplishes the intended purpose
- [ ] Edge cases are properly handled
- [ ] Error conditions are appropriately managed
- [ ] Input validation is implemented where necessary
- [ ] Business logic is correct and complete

**Performance Considerations:**
- [ ] No obvious performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Efficient algorithms and data structures used
- [ ] Database queries are optimized
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
- [ ] Caching strategies implemented where appropriate

### Code Quality and Maintainability

**Code Structure:**
- [ ] Functions and classes have single responsibilities
- [ ] Code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- [ ] Appropriate design patterns are used
- [ ] Code is modular and reusable
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns

**Readability:**
- [ ] Code is self-documenting with clear variable names
- [ ] Complex logic is explained with comments
- [ ] Function and class documentation is complete
- [ ] Code follows consistent formatting standards
- [ ] Magic numbers are replaced with named constants

### Security Review

**Security Checklist:**
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input sanitization implemented
- [ ] SQL injection prevention measures
- [ ] XSS protection in web applications
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checks
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly encrypted
- [ ] Logging doesn't expose sensitive information

### Testing and Documentation

**Test Coverage:**
- [ ] Unit tests cover new functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for complex workflows
- [ ] Test cases include edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Mock objects used appropriately
- [ ] Test names are descriptive and clear

**Documentation:**
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] README files updated if necessary
- [ ] Inline comments explain complex logic
- [ ] Architecture decisions documented
- [ ] Breaking changes documented in changelog

## Review Guidelines

### For Reviewers

**Review Approach:**
1. **Understand the Context**: Read the PR description and linked issues
2. **High-Level Review**: Assess overall approach and architecture
3. **Detailed Review**: Line-by-line code examination
4. **Testing Review**: Verify test coverage and quality
5. **Documentation Review**: Ensure adequate documentation

**Feedback Guidelines:**
- Be constructive and specific in feedback
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Distinguish between must-fix issues and suggestions
- Acknowledge good practices and improvements
- Use collaborative language ("we could..." vs "you should...")

**Review Categories:**
- **Critical**: Must be fixed before merge (security, bugs, breaking changes)
- **Major**: Should be addressed (performance, maintainability)
- **Minor**: Nice to have (style, optimization suggestions)
- **Nitpick**: Optional improvements (formatting, naming)

### For Authors

**Responding to Feedback:**
- Address all feedback or explain why changes aren't needed
- Ask questions if feedback is unclear
- Make requested changes in separate commits for easy tracking
- Update tests and documentation as needed
- Re-request review after making changes

**Best Practices:**
- Keep pull requests small and focused
- Provide clear commit messages
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Link to relevant issues or documentation
- Be open to feedback and suggestions

## Code Review Tools and Automation

### Required Tools

**Static Analysis:**
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis
- **ESLint/Pylint**: Language-specific linting
- **Security Scanners**: SAST tools for vulnerability detection

**Automated Checks:**
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and building
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage requirement
- **Dependency Scanning**: Vulnerability checks for dependencies

### Review Metrics

**Quality Metrics:**
- Average review time: < 24 hours
- Review participation rate: > 90%
- Defect escape rate: < 5%
- Code coverage: > 80%

## Common Review Patterns

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Code Issues:**
- God classes or functions (too much responsibility)
- Deep nesting (> 3 levels)
- Long parameter lists (> 5 parameters)
- Commented-out code
- TODO comments without tickets

**Review Issues:**
- Rubber stamp approvals without thorough review
- Nitpicking on style when automated tools should handle it
- Personal preference feedback without technical justification
- Delayed reviews causing development bottlenecks

### Best Practices

**Code Patterns:**
- Early returns to reduce nesting
- Descriptive variable and function names
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Proper logging levels and messages
- Configuration externalization

**Review Patterns:**
- Focus on logic and architecture over style
- Suggest alternative approaches when appropriate
- Verify test scenarios match requirements
- Check for potential race conditions or concurrency issues
- Validate error handling and edge cases

## Training and Resources

### Required Training

**For All Developers:**
- Code review best practices workshop
- Security-focused code review training
- Tool-specific training (SonarQube, etc.)

**For Senior Developers:**
- Advanced architectural review techniques
- Mentoring junior developers in code review
- Performance optimization review skills

### Resources

**Documentation:**
- Internal coding standards wiki
- Security review guidelines
- Performance optimization checklist
- Tool documentation and tutorials

**External Resources:**
- Google's Code Review Guidelines
- Microsoft's Code Review Best Practices
- OWASP Code Review Guide
- Clean Code principles

## Escalation Process

### When to Escalate

- Disagreement on architectural decisions
- Security concerns that need expert review
- Performance issues requiring specialized knowledge
- Deadline conflicts with review quality

### Escalation Path

1. **Team Lead**: Technical disagreements
2. **Architect**: Architectural decisions
3. **Security Team**: Security-related issues
4. **Engineering Manager**: Process or timeline issues

## Metrics and Continuous Improvement
