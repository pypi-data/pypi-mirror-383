    """The result of resuming an interruptible graph.

    This is a subclass of `GraphRunResult` that adds the `next_node`
    attribute. When the graph finishes its run and reaches an `End` node,
    the outcome is the same as a normal `GraphRunResult` and the `next_node`
    is empty.

    When the graph is interrupted by a `InterruptNode`, the `output` is empty
    and the `next_node` contains the node that has interrupted the run
    and will be executed next when the graph is resumed.

    The `next_node` and the `state` can be modified and passed back to
    the `proceed` method and will overwrite the values in the persistence
    in that case. The `proceed` method will then call the `run` method of the
    `next_node`.

    Attributes:
        state: The state of the graph at the end of the proceed attempt.
        next_node: The last node that was executed during the proceed attempt.
        persistence: The persistence implementation that was used for
        this graph run.
