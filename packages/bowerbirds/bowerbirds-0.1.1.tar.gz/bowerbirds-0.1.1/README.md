# Bowerbirds üê¶

**Bowerbirds** is a Python library that helps you **organize messy AI/ML projects** so they are easier to manage and use with different AI models. Even if you don‚Äôt have a model api, it can generate a **ready-to-use JSON file** that works with external AI/ML tools. You can also plug in your favorite model providers like **LiteLLM**.


---

## Features ‚ú®

- Automatically structure your **unstructured AI/ML project**.
- Generate a **ready-to-use JSON file** for external models.
- Optionally integrate with **LiteLLM** or any model provider.
- Simple **CLI** and **Python API** for easy usage.
- Lightweight, modular, and beginner-friendly.
