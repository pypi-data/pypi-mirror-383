              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# N-gram Punctuator

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ngram-punctuator)](https://pypi.org/project/ngram-punctuator)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/pengzhendong/ngram-punctuator)](https://github.com/pengzhendong/ngram-punctuator/blob/master/LICENSE)

An N-gram based punctuation restoration tool that automatically adds punctuation to text without punctuation marks.

## Features

- Restores punctuation marks to unpunctuated text using N-gram language models
- Supports multiple punctuation marks including `!`, `'`, `,`, `.`, `?`, `。`, `…`, `，`, `、`, `！` and `？`
- Configurable N-gram order (3-gram to 6-gram)
- Beam search algorithm for optimal punctuation placement
- CLI interface for easy usage
- Support for both English and Chinese text

## Installation

```bash
pip install ngram-punctuator
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic usage
ngram-punctuator "how are you"
# >>> how are you?

# Specify N-gram order (3, 4, 5, or 6)
ngram-punctuator --order 4 "你好吗"
# >>> 你好吗？

# Adjust beam size for better accuracy (higher values may improve results but slow down processing)
ngram-punctuator --beam-size 10 "Artificial intelligence is changing our daily lives in many ways from smart home devices to personalized recommendations it makes technology more convenient and efficient"
# >>> Artificial intelligence is changing our daily lives, in many ways, from smart home devices to personalized recommendations, it makes technology more convenient and efficient.

# Limit the maximum number of punctuation marks to add
ngram-punctuator --max-puncts 8 "中华文明有着五千年的悠久历史从夏商周到秦汉唐宋元明清每个朝代都留下了丰富的文化遗产长城故宫兵马俑敦煌莫高窟这些都是中华民族的宝贵财富值得我们好好保护和传承"
# >>> 中华文明有着五千年的悠久历史，从夏商周到秦汉唐宋元明清，每个朝代都留下了丰富的文化遗产长城故宫兵马俑，敦煌莫高窟，这些都是中华民族的宝贵财富，值得我们好好保护和传承。

# Adjust perplexity drop ratio for more conservative punctuation
ngram-punctuator --ppl-drop-ratio 0.1 "这个new feature的UI设计需要optimize一下user experience特别是mobile端的responsive design要考虑cross platform compatibility还有API的integration问题我们要做AB testing来validate hypothesis"
# >>> 这个 new feature 的 UI 设计需要 optimize 一下 user experience, 特别是 mobile 端的 responsive design, 要考虑 cross platform compatibility, 还有 API 的 integration 问题，我们要做 AB testing, 来 validate hypothesis.
```

### Python API

```python
from ngram_punctuator import Punctuator

# Initialize punctuator with default settings (3-gram model)
punctuator = Punctuator()

# Add punctuation to text
text = "The sun sets slowly over the calm blue ocean"
result = punctuator.predict(text)
print(result)  # Output: "The sun sets, slowly over the calm blue ocean."

# Initialize with specific N-gram order
punctuator = Punctuator(order=4)

# Advanced usage with parameters
result = punctuator.predict(
    text="人工智能技术正在深刻改变我们的生活方式从智能手机到自动驾驶汽车从医疗诊断到金融风控AI的应用已经渗透到各个领域",
    beam_size=10,
    max_puncts=5,
    ppl_drop_ratio=0.15
)
print(result)  # Output: "人工智能技术，正在深刻改变我们的生活方式。从智能手机到自动驾驶汽车从医疗诊断到金融风控 AI 的应用，已经渗透到各个领域。"
```

## How It Works

The N-gram Punctuator uses statistical language models to determine the most likely positions for punctuation marks in unpunctuated text:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: The input text is tokenized using a BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) tokenizer
2. **N-gram Perplexity**: N-gram language models calculate perplexity for different punctuation placement possibilities
3. **Beam Search**: A beam search algorithm explores multiple punctuation placement options
4. **Optimization**: The system selects the punctuation arrangement with the lowest perplexity

The models are trained on large text corpora and can effectively restore punctuation for both English and Chinese text.

## Parameters

- `order`: N-gram order (3, 4, 5, or 6). Higher orders may capture more context but require more computational resources.
- `beam_size`: Number of candidates to keep during beam search. Larger values may improve accuracy but slow down processing.
- `max_puncts`: Maximum number of punctuation marks to insert. If not specified, it defaults to 1/4 of the text length.
- `ppl_drop_ratio`: Minimum perplexity drop ratio (between 0.0 and 1.0). Higher values make the system more conservative in adding punctuation.
