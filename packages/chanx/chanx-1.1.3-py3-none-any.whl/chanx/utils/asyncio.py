"""
Asyncio task management utilities for Chanx.

This module provides enhanced task management for asynchronous operations
in Chanx WebSocket consumers. It offers utilities to safely create
and manage background tasks with proper error handling, database connection
cleanup, and task tracking.

Key features:
- Structured error logging for background tasks
- Task tracking to prevent memory leaks from forgotten tasks
- Support for context variables to maintain context across task boundaries

The module helps maintain a clean and reliable asynchronous execution environment
for WebSocket consumers, which often need to perform background operations while
maintaining an active connection.
