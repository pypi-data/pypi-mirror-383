"""
Standard outgoing message types for Chanx websockets.

Provides ready-to-use message types for server-to-client communication:
- PongMessage: Response to ping requests
- ErrorMessage: Communicates errors to clients
- AuthenticationMessage: Informs clients about authentication results
- CompleteMessage: Signals completion of message processing
- GroupCompleteMessage: Signals completion of group message distribution
- EventCompleteMessage: Signals completion of event processing

These messages handle common communication patterns in WebSocket applications
including status updates, error reporting, and process completion signals.
