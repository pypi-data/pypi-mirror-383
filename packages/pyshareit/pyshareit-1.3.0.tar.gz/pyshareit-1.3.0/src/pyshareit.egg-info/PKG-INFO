# pyshareit: Ultra-Fast P2P File Sharing

pyshareit is a command-line tool for peer-to-peer file sharing that is fast, secure, and easy to use. Built with Python, it provides a simple terminal interface for discovering devices on your local network and transferring files of any size directly between them.

## Key Features

* **High-Speed Transfers**: Utilizes the QUIC protocol over UDP for transfer speeds significantly faster than traditional methods like FTP or HTTP.
* **No File Size Limits**: Engineered to stream and handle files of any size, from kilobytes to terabytes.
* **Automatic Device Discovery**: Uses mDNS (Bonjour) to automatically find other users on your local network without needing to manage IP addresses.
* **Simple Terminal Interface**: Features a clean, single-screen interface. Sending a file is as simple as selecting a peer and dragging the file into the terminal window.
* **Zero Configuration**: On first launch, it automatically generates the necessary security certificates. No manual setup is required.
* **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows, wherever Python is supported.

## Installation

> **Prerequisite**: Python 3.9 or higher is required.

To install pyshareit, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pyshareit
```

## How to Run

After installation, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
shareit
```

The application will launch, automatically generate security keys if it's the first run, and start discovering other devices on your network.

## Instructions for Use

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the `shareit` command in your terminal.
2. **Discover Peers**: The application will automatically start broadcasting its presence and listening for other users. Discovered devices will appear in the top table.
3. **Select a Target**: Use the arrow keys to navigate the table and select the device you want to send a file to. The status log at the bottom will confirm your selection.
4. **Send a File**: Drag a file from your desktop or file manager and drop it directly onto the terminal window where pyshareit is running. The transfer will start immediately.
5. **Receive a File**: The application is always listening for incoming files. When another user sends you a file, it will be saved automatically in the same directory from which you launched the application.
6. **Quit**: Press `q` to shut down the application gracefully.
