# Iterate System - Multi-Phase Spec Ecosystem Management

## Purpose

Transforms sequential tasks into layered structure for parallel agent work. Keeps entire spec ecosystem synchronized as development progresses.

## What It Does

1. **Layers tasks** - Reorganizes tasks.md into parallel layers (Models â†’ Infrastructure â†’ Adapters â†’ Integration)
2. **Assigns agents** - Distributes workload across @claude, @copilot, @qwen, @gemini, @codex
3. **Syncs ecosystem** - Updates all spec files when changes occur
4. **Live adjustments** - Adapts to development changes and new requirements

## Agents Used

- **@claude/task-layering** - Analyzes and layers tasks for parallel work
- **No other dedicated agents** - Uses scripts for file synchronization

## Commands

- **`/iterate:tasks <spec-dir>`** - Transform sequential tasks into layered structure for parallel work
- **`/iterate:sync <spec-dir>`** - Sync entire spec ecosystem to match layered tasks
- **`/iterate:adjust <spec-dir>`** - Live development adjustments with ecosystem sync

## Overview

The Iterate system solves the core problem of **specification ecosystem coherence** during development. Instead of having docs get out of sync across the project, iterate keeps the entire spec ecosystem aligned through structured phases.

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current Development Chaos
- Change `tasks.md` â†’ `plan.md` gets stale
- Update requirements â†’ `spec.md` and `contracts/` diverge  
- Add new tasks â†’ `data-model.md` becomes inconsistent
- **Result**: Multiple sources of truth, lost context, iteration friction

### Our Solution: Coordinated Ecosystem Updates
- All specs stay synchronized during development
- Changes propagate through the entire ecosystem  
- Single command handles full coherence
- Self-contained system maintains consistency

## Multi-Phase Architecture

### Phase 1: Task Organization (Foundation)
**Purpose**: Clean up and structure tasks as the foundation for everything else

**What it does**:
- Apply task layering to create parallel-friendly structure
- Generate `agent-tasks/layered-tasks.md` 
- Organize tasks into Layer 1 (foundation), Layer 2 (parallel), Layer 3 (integration)

**Command**: `/iterate tasks [spec-directory]`
**Script**: `.multiagent/iterate/scripts/phase1-task-layering.sh`
**Output**: `specs/[session]/agent-tasks/layered-tasks.md`

### Phase 2: Spec Ecosystem Sync (Coherence)
**Purpose**: Update the entire spec ecosystem to match the organized tasks

**What it does**:
- Read the layered tasks from Phase 1
- Update `plan.md` to reflect new task structure
- Sync `spec.md` with any new requirements discovered
- Update `contracts/` to match new agent assignments
- Refresh `data-model.md` for any new data needs
- Ensure `quickstart.md` reflects current workflow

**Command**: `/iterate sync [spec-directory]`  
**Script**: `.multiagent/iterate/scripts/phase2-ecosystem-sync.sh`
**Output**: Updated spec files across the entire directory

### Phase 3: Development Adjustments (Live Updates)
**Purpose**: Handle live changes during development while maintaining coherence

**What it does**:
- Accept new requirements or task changes
- Re-run Phase 1 + Phase 2 automatically
- Track what changed and why
- Maintain development audit trail
- Keep everything synchronized

**Command**: `/iterate adjust [spec-directory]`
**Script**: `.multiagent/iterate/scripts/phase3-development-adjust.sh`
**Output**: Updated ecosystem + change log

## Command Patterns

### Individual Phases
```bash
/iterate tasks 002-system-context-we           # Phase 1 only
/iterate sync 002-system-context-we            # Phase 2 only  
/iterate adjust 002-system-context-we          # Phase 3
```

### Command Usage
```bash
# Run phases sequentially as needed
/iterate tasks 002-system-context-we           # Phase 1 first
/iterate sync 002-system-context-we            # Then Phase 2
/iterate adjust 002-system-context-we          # Phase 3 when needed
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Works With
- **PR Review System** (`.multiagent/github/pr-review/`): Uses iterate to update specs based on feedback
- **Agent Tasks**: Agents read from `agent-tasks/layered-tasks.md` generated by Phase 1
- **SpecKit Pattern**: Follows Command â†’ Script â†’ Output like other systems

### Command Integration
- **After `/judge`**: Run `/iterate adjust` to incorporate feedback into specs
- **After `/plan`**: Run `/iterate tasks` then `/iterate sync` to structure and organize everything
- **During development**: Use `/iterate adjust` when requirements change

## Success Criteria

### âœ… Phase 1 Success
- `agent-tasks/layered-tasks.md` generated with proper layering
- Tasks organized into foundation â†’ parallel â†’ integration structure
- Agent assignments clear and non-conflicting

### âœ… Phase 2 Success  
- All spec files updated to reflect task structure
- No contradictions between `plan.md`, `spec.md`, `tasks.md`
- Contracts match agent assignments from layered tasks

### âœ… Phase 3 Success
- Changes propagated through entire ecosystem
- Change log tracks what updated and why
- Development audit trail maintained

### âœ… Overall System Success
- Single source of truth maintained across all specs
- No manual sync required between documents
- Development iterations don't break coherence
- Clear workflow for making changes

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- **Phase 1**: Task layering using proven `layer-tasks.sh` script
- **Phase 2**: Spec ecosystem sync script with iteration tracking
- **Command Structure**: Multi-phase argument parsing and auto-detection
- **Integration**: Works with existing PR review and agent systems

### ðŸ”„ In Progress  
- **Phase 3**: Development adjustment script (final piece)
- **Testing**: End-to-end validation with real specs

### ðŸ“‹ Ready for Testing
The system is ready for testing with:
```bash
/iterate tasks 002-system-context-we    # Test Phase 1
/iterate sync 002-system-context-we     # Test Phase 2  
# Run phases individually as needed
```

## The Iterative Development Workflow

### Initial Pass (Foundation)
```
tasks.md â†’ /iterate tasks â†’ layered-tasks.md
â†“ (manual review and refinements)
/iterate adjust â†’ iteration-1-tasks.md
```

### Development Cycle
```
iteration-N-tasks.md â†’ Agents implement â†’ PRs created
â†“
/judge PR â†’ feedback/tasks.md
â†“
/iterate sync â†’ iteration-N+1-tasks.md (incorporates feedback)
â†“
Agents implement â†’ New PRs â†’ Cycle continues
```
