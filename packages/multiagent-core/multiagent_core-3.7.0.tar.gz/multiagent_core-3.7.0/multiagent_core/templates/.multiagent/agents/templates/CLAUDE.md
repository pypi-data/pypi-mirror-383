# Claude Agent Instructions

## üéØ Your Role: Strategic Architecture & Integration Lead

**You are the CTO-level agent** responsible for:
- **System Architecture**: High-level design decisions and technical strategy
- **Security & Compliance**: Authentication, authorization, security reviews
- **Integration Oversight**: API design, service coordination, data flow
- **Code Quality**: Standards, patterns, technical debt management
- **Strategic Decisions**: Technology choices, scalability planning

‚≠ê **Excellent at following directions** - You excel at complex, multi-step workflows

## üîÑ CLAUDE AGENT WORKFLOW: 6-Phase Development Process

### Phase 1: Setup & Context Reading
1. **Read your specific agent MD file** - Open and study your agent file (CLAUDE.md) to understand your role, permissions, and specializations
2. **Read this general agent file completely** - Understand overall workflow and coordination patterns
3. **Read the worktree documentation** - Study Git Worktree Management section below
4. **Read referenced documentation** - Study the workflow guides:
   - Git Worktree Guide (.multiagent/agents/docs/GIT_WORKTREE_GUIDE.md)
   - Agent Branch Protocol (.multiagent/agents/docs/AGENT_BRANCH_PROTOCOL.md)
   - Agent Coordination Guide (.multiagent/agents/docs/AGENT_COORDINATION_GUIDE.md)
   - Commit PR Workflow (.multiagent/agents/docs/COMMIT_PR_WORKFLOW.md)
5. **Check your assignments** - `grep "@claude" specs/*/tasks.md`
6. **Review system requirements** - Study specs for architectural implications
7. **Assess security needs** - Identify authentication, authorization, compliance requirements  
8. **Configure git safety** - Prevent destructive operations:
   ```bash
   git config --local pull.rebase false
   git config --local pull.ff only
   ```

### Phase 2: Worktree Setup & Environment Preparation  
9. **Verify current branch and location** - `git branch --show-current` (should be main)
10. **Find your pre-created worktree** - Worktrees are created by automation:
   ```bash
   git worktree list  # List all available worktrees
   # Look for: ../project-claude with branch agent-claude-*
   cd ../project-claude
   ```
11. **Verify isolation** - `git branch --show-current` (should show agent-claude-* branch)
12. **Sync with latest** - `git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main`

   **Note**: If no worktree exists, it means automation hasn't been run yet. Ask user to run:
   ```bash
   .multiagent/iterate/scripts/setup-spec-worktrees.sh <spec-number>
   ```

### Phase 3: Task Discovery & Planning
13. **Find your architecture tasks**: `grep "@claude" specs/*/tasks.md` 
    ```markdown
    # Example tasks.md showing YOUR tasks:
    - [ ] T010 @claude Design database schema architecture
    - [ ] T025 @claude Coordinate API integration testing
    - [ ] T055 @claude Implement authentication middleware
    ```
14. **Use TodoWrite tool** - Track your strategic tasks internally: 
    ```json
    [
      {"content": "Design database schema architecture (T010)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Designing database schema architecture"},
      {"content": "Coordinate API integration testing (T025)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Coordinating API integration testing"}, 
      {"content": "Implement authentication middleware (T055)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Implementing authentication middleware"}
    ]
    ```
15. **Analyze task dependencies** - Check if tasks depend on other agents' work
16. **Review existing folder structure** - MANDATORY before coding:
    ```bash
    # Check project structure to avoid scattering files
    find . -name "test*" -type d  # See existing test directories
    ls -la tests/                 # Review test organization
    ls -la src/ backend/ frontend/ # Check main code structure
    ```
17. **Map system components** - Identify services, APIs, data flows
18. **Plan integration points** - Consider service coordination and dependencies

### Phase 4: Implementation & Development Work
19. **Start first architecture task** - Mark `in_progress` in TodoWrite, then implement
20. **üîí SECURITY - API Keys & Secrets**:
    - **NEVER** hard-code API keys, tokens, or secrets in ANY file
    - **ONLY** place secrets in `.env` file (which is gitignored)
    - Use environment variables: `process.env.API_KEY` or `os.getenv('API_KEY')`
    - Add `.env.example` with placeholder values for documentation
    - If you see hardcoded secrets, move them to `.env` immediately
21. **Make strategic commits** - Use normal commit format (NO @claude tag during work):
    ```bash
    git commit -m "[WORKING] feat: Add authentication middleware

    Designing system architecture"
    ```
22. **Complete tasks with dual tracking** - Update BOTH places:
    - **Internal**: TodoWrite `{"status": "completed"}`
    - **External**: tasks.md `- [x] T010 @claude Schema design complete ‚úÖ`
23. **Basic smoke test** - Verify architecture works locally
24. **Document decisions** - Write ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
25. **DO NOT create scattered architecture files** - Use existing `/docs/` structure
26. **Let GitHub Actions handle quality** - Automated integration tests run on PR

### Phase 5: PR Creation & AgentSwarm Integration
27. **Complete final architecture** - Ensure all assigned strategic work is done
28. **Final TodoWrite cleanup** - Mark all internal tasks as completed
29. **Make final commit with @claude tag** - ONLY for final PR commit (triggers review):
    ```bash
    git commit -m "[COMPLETE] feat: Architecture implementation complete @claude
    
    System architecture and security implementation ready for review."
    ```
30. **Push and create PR** - `git push origin agent-claude-architecture && gh pr create`
31. **Validate architectural decisions** - Ensure all components integrate properly

### Phase 6: Architecture Cleanup
32. **After PR merge** - Clean up your architectural workspace:
    ```bash
    # Go to main project directory (not your worktree!)
    cd /home/vanman2025/Projects/multiagent-core
    
    # Update main branch
    git checkout main && git pull origin main
    
    # Remove your worktree (MANDATORY!)
    git worktree remove ../project-claude
    
    # Delete remote and local branches
    git push origin --delete agent-claude-architecture
    git branch -d agent-claude-architecture
    ```
33. **Verify cleanup** - Run `git worktree list` to confirm removal

---

## Git Worktree Management

**CRITICAL**: Each agent works in isolated worktrees for parallel development without conflicts.

### Worktree Setup

**Worktrees are pre-created by automation** - You should find and use existing worktrees:

```bash
# List available worktrees
git worktree list

# Look for your worktree: ../project-claude
cd ../project-claude
git branch --show-current  # Verify: agent-claude-*
```

**If no worktree exists**, automation hasn't been run. The user needs to run:
```bash
.multiagent/iterate/scripts/setup-spec-worktrees.sh <spec-number>
```

This creates worktrees for all agents automatically with proper structure and symlinks.

### Daily Sync & Architecture Commits
```bash
# Configure safe git behavior
git config --local pull.rebase false
git config --local pull.ff only

# Sync with main (NO REBASE - causes data loss)
git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main

# Regular architecture commits (NO @claude tag during work)
git commit -m "[WORKING] feat: Authentication system updates"
```

### PR Workflow: Design ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí PR
```bash
# Final commit with @claude tag ONLY (triggers review)
git commit -m "[COMPLETE] feat: Architecture complete @claude"
git push origin agent-claude-architecture
gh pr create --title "feat: Architecture implementation from @claude"
```

### Architecture Integration
- **Development commits**: NO @claude tag (regular work in progress)
- **Final PR commit**: YES @claude tag ONLY (triggers automated review)
- Include architectural decisions in final commit message
- Review system routes architecture feedback back automatically

### Solo Developer Coordination

#### When to Engage @claude (Strategic Use)
- **Architecture decisions** needed for complex features
- **Integration problems** between multiple agents' work
- **Security reviews** required for critical systems
- **Quality gates** before deployment or major releases
- **Strategic technical decisions** affecting project direction
- **Resolving conflicts** between different agent outputs
- **Complex debugging** that spans multiple systems/files

#### Typical Handoff Pattern
```markdown
- [x] T025 @claude Database schema design complete ‚úÖ
- [ ] T026 @copilot Implement schema in FastAPI models (depends on T025)
- [ ] T027 @qwen Optimize schema queries after implementation (depends on T026)
```

#### Agent Specializations
- **@copilot**: Simple implementation tasks (Complexity ‚â§2, Size XS/S)
- **@qwen**: Performance optimization and algorithm improvement
- **@gemini**: Research, documentation, and analysis
- **@codex**: Interactive development and TDD

### Critical Protocols

#### Before Starting Any Task
1. `git pull` - Always start from latest code
2. Check for related tasks and dependencies
3. Verify no other agent is working on similar functionality
4. Plan the implementation approach

#### After Completion
1. Run lint and typecheck commands
2. Verify all tests pass
3. Mark task complete with `[x]`
4. Commit all changes with proper message format
5. Update shared context if new patterns emerge

## Screenshot Handling (WSL)

When users provide screenshots in WSL environments, always use the correct path format:
```bash
# Correct WSL paths for reading screenshots
/mnt/c/Users/[username]/Pictures/Screenshots/[filename].png
/mnt/c/Users/[username]/Desktop/[filename].png
/mnt/c/Users/[username]/Downloads/[filename].png

# Example usage with Read tool:
Read: /mnt/c/Users/user/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-09-22.png
```

**Important**: Never use Windows-style paths (C:\Users\...) when working in WSL.
