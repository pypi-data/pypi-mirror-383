Overview
--------

**Isek** is a modular framework designed for building decentralized Agent-to-Agent (A2A) networks. In Isek, agents are not passive APIs — they are autonomous, proactive entities capable of peer discovery, goal-driven collaboration, and contextual communication.

Key Concepts
------------

Decentralized Autonomy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Isek agents operate in a **fully distributed network** — there is no central server or controller. Each agent can:

- Independently register itself to the network
- Discover and communicate with other peers
- Share and request task-relevant context

This design minimizes single points of failure and enables **scalable cooperation** among heterogeneous agents.

Agent Society
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In Isek, agents form a **self-organizing digital society**, where coordination emerges from peer-to-peer interactions rather than top-down orchestration.

Agents can:

- Broadcast capabilities and goals
- Form ad-hoc collaborations
- Delegate sub-tasks to others
- Learn from past interactions

Built-in LLM Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Every agent can be augmented with a **language model backend** (e.g., GPT) for:

- Natural language understanding
- Dynamic reasoning
- Code/tool execution

This allows agents to adapt, negotiate, and evolve without rigid rule-based behavior.

Composable Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Isek is built on a **modular, extensible architecture**:

- Agent classes can be subclassed and extended
- Tools and APIs can be registered per agent
- Multiple backends (local or cloud) are supported

This makes it ideal for both **lightweight deployments** and **complex multi-agent simulations**.

CLI First, Code Friendly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Isek CLI makes it easy to:

- Bootstrap agents and networks
- Launch demos and tests
- Observe agent behavior in real-time

Behind the scenes, everything is Pythonic and hackable for advanced users.

Why Isek?
---------

> The next generation of systems won't be monoliths — they'll be **networks of intelligent agents**.

Whether you’re building AI-driven simulations, decentralized applications, or research prototypes, Isek gives you the tools to connect, coordinate, and scale agents **at the edge** — not the center.
