# Legal Disclaimer

ISEK is an open-source, permissionless framework for building decentralized, agent-based coordination systems. It is developed and maintained by an independent group of contributors from the global open-source community.

By accessing, using, or building on ISEK or its components, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

1. **ISEK is a technical framework, not a platform or service.**  
   It does not operate, host, or control any network, infrastructure, or agents. All deployments and interactions are independently created and operated by third parties.

2. **You are solely responsible for how you use this project.**  
   Whether you deploy an agent, integrate ISEK components, or interact with other users, any resulting consequences—legal, technical, or otherwise—are entirely your own responsibility.

3. **No warranties or guarantees are provided.**  
   This software is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind. The contributors make no representations about the reliability, legality, or fitness for any purpose.

4. **You must comply with your local laws.**  
   ISEK is a globally accessible project, but its contributors cannot ensure compliance with local regulations. It is your duty to understand and obey the laws of your jurisdiction.

5. **No content moderation or takedown is possible.**  
   The contributors do not review, host, or moderate any content or behavior generated by third-party agents. We do not have the ability or authority to remove or restrict any usage of the framework.
