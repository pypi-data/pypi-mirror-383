1
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:53,512
Ja.

2
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,714
Her country must have great quantity of bread.

3
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:27,088
In transport, on trolleybuses, omnibuses, on locomotives, the Soviet woman has freed the men for a war to the death against the enemy.

4
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:35,853
Confidently, she operates a derrick.

5
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:53,363
För stål.

6
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:54,024
En viktorisk kanon och stål.

7
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:55,946
Våra kvinnor och syster har blivit stålsmältare, smittare, frimare, mekaniker och väldare.

8
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:35,913
En element av krig håller ingen terror för dem.

9
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:38,454
De vet vad man ska göra med kriget.

10
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,795
For their country, their freedom and happiness.

11
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:47,298
The fascist scoundrels have raised their hands against the art of Soviet women.

12
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:47,858
We shall remember.

13
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,740
We shall never forget that.

14
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:41,371
Never will the Nazi thugs turn our splendid sisters, wives and daughters into slaves and handmaidens of the generates.
