1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,581
I cannot help but reflect it.

2
00:00:33,113 --> 00:00:38,676
That if my father had been American and my mother British instead of the other way around I might have got here on my own.

3
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:40,057
Then of course he had a new word for the Duce.

4
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:42,298
The boastful Mussolini had crumpled already.

5
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:43,579
He is now but a lackey and a circus

6
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,468
The merest utensil of his masters will.

7
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,590
For many months we devoted ourselves to preparing to take the offensive in Libya.

8
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:30,875
The very considerable battle which has been proceeding there for the last six weeks in the desert has been most fiercely fought on both sides.

9
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:43,155
For the first time we have made the unfeel, the sharp edge of those tools with which he has enslaved Europe.

10
00:01:43,254 --> 00:02:00,019
I am so glad to be able to place before you, members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, at this moment, when you are entering the war, the proof that with proper weapons

11
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:08,912
and proper organization we are able to beat the life out of the savage Nazi.

12
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:27,786
What Hitlerism is suffering in Libya is only a sample and a foretaste of what we have got to give him and his accomplices wherever this war should lead us in every quarter of the globe.

13
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:32,175
The prime minister next turn to Japan.

14
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,598
What kind of a people do they think we are?

15
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:47,788
Is it possible they do not realize that we shall never cease to persevere against them until they have been taught a lesson which they and the world will never forget?

16
00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:57,956
As the premier spoke we received these pictures from Canada.

17
00:02:58,336 --> 00:03:02,638
Our great dominion on the American continent is on the alert against this new threat from Japan.

18
00:03:03,337 --> 00:03:10,200
Along the Pacific coast, Canadian infantry, artillery and the Royal Canadian Air Force are ready to meet and attack if it comes.

19
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:13,983
In America, Colonel Knox attended the annual graduation of US Navy cadets.

20
00:03:14,522 --> 00:03:17,604
But this year the ceremony was charged with greater significance.

21
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:23,046
The attack without warning on the American Navy at Pearl Harbor has welded the United States into closer unity.

22
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:26,247
A great surge of patriotism has swept the American continent.

23
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:28,830
ARP has come to life.

24
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:33,711
In every city and town in the danger zone they are applying the lessons already learnt in Britain.

25
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,031
Where there's light, there's life.

26
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:39,692
And to the axis where there's life is a good place to drop bombs.

27
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:45,973
In a world at war we receive from the corners of the earth evidence of the growing brotherhood of the free men who fight tyranny.

28
00:03:46,014 --> 00:03:48,895
For the reason we must go back to Mr. Churchill in Congress.

29
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:53,536
If you will allow me to use other language I will say that he must indeed

30
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:58,457
Havar a blind soul.

31
00:03:58,497 --> 00:04:00,497
Who cannot see that some great purpose and design is being worked out here below.

32
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:01,998
Of which we have the honor to be the faithful servants.

33
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:03,960
It is not given to us to peer into the mysteries of the future.

34
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,000
Still I avow my hope and faith.

35
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,419
Sure and inviolate.

36
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:24,793
Det är inte det.

37
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:25,334
Det är inte det.

38
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:26,855
Det är inte det.

39
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:02,728
This is the second part of the story of our prime minister's war conference in the new world.

40
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:08,757
Following his stirring speech to congress in Washington, Mr. Churchill attended the Senate and House of Commons in Ottawa.

41
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:11,259
He was welcomed there by a Canadian guard of honor.

42
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:28,286
Mr Churchill was introduced by Prime Minister Mackenzie King and received a tremendous ovation from the combined houses of Canada's government.

43
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:35,387
We have been concerning the united pacts and resolves of more than 30 states and nations to fight on in unity together and in fidelity one with another without any thought except the totals

44
00:05:51,269 --> 00:06:00,336
And final extirpation of the Hitler tyranny of the Japanese frenzy and the Mussolini flop.

45
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,922
As a fitting tribute to French Canadians, Mr. Churchill also spoke in French.

46
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:12,884
...dans la grande compagnie des nations libératrices et victorieuses.

47
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,401
The peoples of the British Empire may love peace.

48
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:33,302
They do not seek the lands or wealth of any country.

49
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:36,942
But they are a tough and hardy lot.

50
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:51,545
We have not journeyed all this way across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies, because we are made of sugar candy.

51
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:01,673
Look at the Londoners, the Cockneys.

52
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,774
Look what they stood up to.

53
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:05,394
Grim and gay.

54
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:08,096
With their cry, we can take it.

55
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:11,576
And their wartime mood.

56
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:15,278
What's good enough for anybody, good enough for us.

57
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,901
We'll not ask that the rules of the game should be modified.

58
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:26,324
If any, we shall never descend to the German and Japanese level.

59
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:32,031
But if anybody likes to play rough we can play rough too.

60
00:07:32,572 --> 00:07:40,658
The premier then referred to a discussion with the French government before the fall of France.

61
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:51,567
When I warned them that Britain would fight on alone whatever they did their generals told their prime minister and his divided cabinet in three weeks England

62
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,545
We'll have a neck wrung like a chicken.

63
00:07:58,564 --> 00:07:59,045
Some chicken.

64
00:07:59,064 --> 00:07:59,245
Some neck.

65
00:07:59,264 --> 00:07:59,444
Some neck.

66
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:56,119
För resten lämnar vi beskrivningen till Mr. Eden.

67
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:58,219
Vi måste arbeta tillsammans för att vinna varje farm och fjäll.

68
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:58,840
Nu har tiderna stigit.

69
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,860
Vi såg vad som säkert har varit en scen av ganska tuff kämpning.

70
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,520
Några mil norr av Klint.

71
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,041
Russiska och germanska tankar blev knackade ut på vägen.

72
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:04,402
I en dödlig, människa-suffering av den här kriget.

73
00:09:04,422 --> 00:09:05,422
En hållbar frihet för alla deras människor.

74
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:33,321
Journalbilderna från ryska fronten visar bara förödelse och förödelse i det oändliga.

75
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:36,000
Men här är det motsatsen, här är det uppbyggnad.

76
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,761
Ej långt från stridszonen, det är vid Volga.

77
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:41,962
Det är ryssarna som här bygger ett av världens väldigaste kraftverk.

78
00:09:42,423 --> 00:09:48,745
Man frågar sig, ska det kunna rädda det undan krigets förödelse eller ska det väldiga och imponerande kraftverket söndersmulas?
