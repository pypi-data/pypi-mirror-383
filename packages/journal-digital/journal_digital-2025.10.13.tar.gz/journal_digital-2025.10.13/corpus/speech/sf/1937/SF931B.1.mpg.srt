1
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:13,513
Ja.

2
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:40,854
Always a trifle two-faced, is loudly played on a double-sided record.

3
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:44,076
Faster and faster, no sooner made and played than broken.

4
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:47,860
On land, sea and in the air they forever struggle to beat their own shadows.

5
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,584
Whereas the only records more amazing changes in ladies hats, created by Aga Tarup.

6
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,286
Here's a feminine version of a judges wig.

7
00:02:57,205 --> 00:02:59,247
And here's a small scotch, neat of course.

8
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:32,085
White basket straw planted complete with moss and flowers.

9
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:33,706
Only the handle is missing.

10
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,824
A hat in which to cruise smoothly over the permanent waves of life.

11
00:06:00,572 --> 00:06:00,872
Kom igen!

12
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:01,112
Kom igen!

13
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:01,392
Kom igen!

14
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:33,593
Oh!

15
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:33,673
Oh!

16
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:58,812
Kom igen, Mike!

17
00:06:58,831 --> 00:06:59,314
Låt henne röra!
