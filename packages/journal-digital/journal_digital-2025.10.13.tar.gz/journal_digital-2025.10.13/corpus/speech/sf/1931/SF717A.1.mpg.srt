1
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:14,287
Tack.

2
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:15,754
I.

3
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:50,291
He was left with provisions for only five months in one of the loneliest spaces in the world.

4
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:57,774
Nine thousand feet up on the ice cap without any hope of getting into touch with other human beings until the spring.

5
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:04,055
Den långa vinteren har gått, och i mars har en räddningsparty gått ut för att åka de 150 milen till den här herrn i Arktis.

6
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:11,579
Men de blev drivna tillbaka av räddande blizzar, och nu är våra dramatiska bilder, tagna av lieutenant Martin Lindsay, och presenterade i sammanhang med The Times, kommer att ta upp threaden i historien.

7
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,341
Planeet, som var med i utredningen, var snabbt samlat.

8
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:29,245
Det är det vi provisjons och sett av från det bäst kämpe i en attempt to reach the marooned Explorer.

9
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:31,326
Det är det som ska kämma igen.

10
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,947
Fast landing and the planer räck.

11
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:36,247
En SOS var lasten.

12
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:42,968
Kapten Arnberg, en svensk skärmen, flöde kross i Atlantik by way of Iceland och röjde på det bäst.

13
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:48,771
Här hittills med hans mekanik en vals operatör med hjälp av nätet Eskimos.

14
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,891
Vi andra karriärer på planen var alltid det kärre skis.

15
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,079
Stacks of seal meat and other provisions were put aboard.

16
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:04,120
It is impossible for us here in civilization to realize the appalling conditions under which this flight was made.

17
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,901
Weather changes without the least warning.

18
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:13,882
Clouds dropping from 2,000 feet to less than 100, making visibility almost nil.

19
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:18,303
Grave danger is run whilst flying over the ice field in a single-engined machine.

20
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,153
A forced landing means almost certain death from exposure.

21
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:28,596
But the airmen made light of their task and so set off without delay into the arctic wastes.

22
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,759
Fresh supplies of oil were taken by sled to the landing ground.

23
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,845
And members of the expedition fed the burning oil into baths to keep up a constant smoke signal for the return of the searchers.

24
00:08:40,956 --> 00:08:43,216
As time wore on, their anxiety grew.

25
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:48,898
But at last a speck was seen in the sky, and Captain Arnberg made a perfect landing.

26
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:57,740
He had sighted the rescue party, led by Watkins, and with them was Courtauld, fit and well, 120 miles from the base.

27
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,881
And there he is with his rescuers.

28
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:10,184
What a wonderful moment for the young explorer, after five months alone in the Greenland snows, to be with companions again.

29
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:14,775
To see the sun after weeks of darkness in a snowed up tent.

30
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:19,496
And his first pipe for tobacco ran out many weeks before.

31
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:23,938
There's Chapman with him, one of the rescue party.

32
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,099
There's Watkins, the leader.

33
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,720
And the other member was Reinhold.

34
00:09:30,681 --> 00:09:32,660
What a difference a real wash makes.

35
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,142
Now I bet that cigar tasted good.

36
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:41,168
And there he is, shaven of his locks and beard, but a lot thinner.

37
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:44,573
Then, goodbye to Captain Orenberg.

38
00:09:45,254 --> 00:09:47,118
And thanks, old man, for your help.
