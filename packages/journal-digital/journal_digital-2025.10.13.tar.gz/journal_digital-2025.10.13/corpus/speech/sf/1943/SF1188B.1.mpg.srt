1
00:00:01,512 --> 00:00:07,458
Fläggen av tre stora nationer i Moskva gav token av frihetsspiritet som kallade denna konferens i Sovjetkampanjen.

2
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:11,320
En konferens där huvudmålet var att snabba den sista förlossningen av Tyskland.

3
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:16,065
Första tillgången var den amerikanska statssekreteraren, veterankonsul Kordell Howell.

4
00:00:16,606 --> 00:00:24,111
Välkomna av M. Litvinov och M. Molotov.

5
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:26,634
Red Army Band spelade Star Spangled Banner.

6
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:40,554
Den inspekterade Garabana.

7
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:52,738
Den förbryterna för en sekretär.

8
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:52,819
En.

9
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:08,245
Följde av God Säver Kingen.

10
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:34,239
Väldigt liten tid var spänd i formaler.

11
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:44,117
This conference had met for business discussions between busy men, and the speed with which they arrived at decisions gave ample proof of their determination to prosecute all war matters without delay.

12
00:01:44,156 --> 00:01:50,822
The conference covered not only military matters but many other topics, ranging from the punishment of war criminals to post-war security.

13
00:01:51,802 --> 00:01:57,087
In the field of military operations, the whole plan of action by each of the allies was fully and freely conveyed to the others.

14
00:01:57,748 --> 00:02:03,009
In the presence of each nation's military advisers, the intentions and strategy of each were made clear and mutually agreed.

15
00:02:03,028 --> 00:02:05,728
...table in the Kremlin to sign the declaration of security.

16
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,469
First, the representative of the Soviet Union.

17
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:19,331
Then the United States.

18
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:25,573
Great Britain next.

19
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:41,350
And lastly, the representative of China, who, though not actively engaged in fighting Germans, is nonetheless at war with Germany.

20
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:44,453
The meeting ended as it had begun, in great cordiality.

21
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:50,695
We have the word of our foreign secretary that full understanding now exists between the English-speaking peoples and the USSR.

22
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:55,179
Nothing could be a better guarantee of our final victory than the war against Germany.

23
00:02:55,871 --> 00:03:05,193
Detta är för den treviga konferensen, så långt förväntat, så ofta påbörjad.

24
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:08,093
För några dagar blir Teheran fokus på världen.

25
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:12,776
Snart efter kriget kom brittiska och röda armésoldater till hand här i Iran.

26
00:03:13,415 --> 00:03:15,317
Det var den enda landets kommunikation vi hade.

27
00:03:15,776 --> 00:03:19,677
Det var fint att den första mötena av Churchill, Roosevelt och Stalin skulle vara här.

28
00:03:25,604 --> 00:03:28,866
Det här är marshal Voroshilov, sovjetkommissar för försäkring.

29
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:29,187
På Solan.

30
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:57,330
It was not concerned with the future, but with the glorious past.

31
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,153
Mr. Churchill was to present to Marshal Stalin the Stalingrad sword.

32
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:08,222
The gift from our king on behalf of all the peoples of the British Empire to the heroic defenders of the great steel city in southern Russia.

33
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:12,026
Acknowledgement of the most gallant and most desperate stand in all this war.

34
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:14,895
Världens framtid, som skapade en tid av lycka mot de tyska invandrarna.

35
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:20,115
Bredvid hårdbäraren, som tyvärr öppnar kamerans syn, kan man se hur Stalin kastade hårdbäraren.

36
00:04:49,714 --> 00:05:05,341
Mr. Churchill är tydligt med om det här när han pratar med den unga Shah of Persia.

37
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:17,584
Han hade klubbat tillsammans för att presentera honom med de här gifterna som var handlade till honom av non-kommissionerade officer av regimens representanter.

38
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:35,992
Konferensen slutade, som alla stora konferenser, med grupper som ställde sig inför Newsreel och Press.

39
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,153
Superficially they always seem very much the same kind of picture.

40
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:07,096
But it requires very little imagination to read into the lines behind the picture.

41
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:13,382
This one stands for the attempts by the three greatest nations fighting Germany to reach common ground and understanding.

42
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:15,043
To act as allies should.

43
00:06:15,545 --> 00:06:19,487
To deliver the most telling blows at the enemy in the most vital places at the right time.

44
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:19,648
To come.

45
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:27,562
Present appearances suggest that the men who guide our destiny have found the common factor that will bring victory and follow it with peace.

46
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:31,345
That is the best we can hope for and the least we have a right to expect.

47
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:33,107
...far eastern fleet set out.

48
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,367
Battleships, cruisers, aircraft carriers, destroyers...

49
00:06:51,283 --> 00:06:52,783
and transports with troops aboard.

50
00:06:53,564 --> 00:07:01,670
Invasion of Tarawa under the command of Harry Hill.

51
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,170
...of the United States Marines.

52
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:04,932
This was an all-American show.

53
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:09,814
Before the battle, a service was held on board each ship before the action was over. ...

54
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:27,425
Aircraft overhead.

55
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:31,166
But things have changed in the Pacific and those were American planes, not Japs.

56
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:32,769
Going on ahead for the softening up.

57
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:36,511
They dropped a thousand tons of bombs on these coral isles by the sleepy lagoon.

58
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:38,992
Only the lagoons were not sleepy anymore.

59
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,875
Japanese occupiers for two years had turned them into solid hard-shelled...

60
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:03,088
Världskastningarna öppnar upp och många av landningskraften får direkt hitt.

61
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:12,480
Men det är en mil som är allvarlig.

62
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,084
Den centrala fortifikationen av Tarawa.

63
00:08:14,384 --> 00:08:16,507
Den tuffaste objektiven i hela den här tuffa ringen.

64
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:23,326
They're ashore.

65
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:25,930
And what a story those scorched and withered palms reveal.

66
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,331
Surely no living thing could have gone on living.

67
00:08:28,572 --> 00:08:40,903
But the Japs were living in their foxholes deep in the coral under concrete.

68
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:45,187
Only a strip 20 feet wide was the first beachhead between water and Japanese machine guns.

69
00:08:45,798 --> 00:08:48,164
But the marines made it wider and deeper and died.

70
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:49,788
And more came on and more died.

71
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:51,432
Over a thousand killed in 76 hours.

72
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:18,313
Barbed wire to catch and hold the invaders under the muzzle of automatic guns.

73
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:22,777
Bombproof pillboxes that had stood up to the most murderous hail afar the Pacific ever heard and saw.

74
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:29,721
And inside them, Japanese soldiers whose highest and before your eyes tells all you need to know about the kind of hell it was.

75
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,923
Coast guns pounded into scrap metal.

76
00:09:55,631 --> 00:09:56,133
...var koreaner.

77
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:58,234
De gav upp glädjande.

78
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:01,076
En del av en krig som USA svarade att förlora i Nordafrikas konferens.

79
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,971
Very few of the Japs themselves were taken prisoner.

80
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:07,393
Six thousand Japanese died for their vile cause of conquest.

81
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:10,654
The wounded received treatment.

82
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:15,498
It's quiet now in Tehran.

83
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:19,940
This was the scene of the first allied offensive action against the Japanese in the Pacific.

84
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,782
Warships, aircraft carriers and transports with full air protection.

85
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:26,344
Setting out to retake the southeast Solomons, the Tulagi area.

86
00:10:41,243 --> 00:10:43,264
In the landing craft, marines and equipment.

87
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:56,447
This operation was carried out as a complete surprise, opening up with a bombardment.

88
00:10:56,748 --> 00:11:00,028
Like nearly all naval actions, it all looks a bit vague and distant.

89
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:02,570
But there's nothing vague where those shells are landing.

90
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,782
The marines go ashore to overcome what remains of resistance.

91
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:20,764
To turn out the Japanese from the island they conquered so recently.

92
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:21,705
This was a Japanese camp.

93
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,326
It has now become a stronghold of American marines from which they can clear the islands completely.

94
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:26,008
The stars and stripes go up in place of the rising sun.

95
00:11:26,107 --> 00:11:27,389
That's cause for congratulations.

96
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,192
The Ocean Might of Britain's Friend Across the Atlantic.

97
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:52,714
The Ocean Might of Britain's Friend Across the Atlantic
