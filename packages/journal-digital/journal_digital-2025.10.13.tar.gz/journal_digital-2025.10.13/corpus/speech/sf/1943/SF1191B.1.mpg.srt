1
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:11,949
Flying Fortresses and Liberators of the US Army 8th Air Force heading for Berlin.

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,591
This was the first full-scale daylight attack on the heart and center of the Nazi war and political machine.

3
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:27,437
Following up the many thousands of tons already dropped by the Royal Air Force, these Americans were going to tell Hitler that no city in Germany is safe from heavy bombing by night or day.

4
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:30,768
I den här attacken skickades 68 kraftbombare ner.

5
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:32,651
Men hundratals gick där och kom tillbaka.

6
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,673
Och med krigarna förstörde de 176 krigarna i den här första kriget ensam.

7
00:00:35,692 --> 00:00:36,774
Och det är Berlin nedanför.

8
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:10,807
Mamma är borta.

9
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,703
För nära uppfattning kommer vi till en stillbild som visar en kluster av bombar som hittar en fabriksdistrikt.

10
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,865
Alltid där och tillbaka var Fortressen och Liberatorn attackerade.

11
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:55,647
Det här flyget som har en kamera har en motorn utav aktion.

12
00:01:55,668 --> 00:02:01,852
Det är propellern.

13
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:04,915
De kommer in på landet efter en stor strid mot vikten i kriget i Berlin.

14
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:07,677
Några av bombarna sätter ut fläror för att varma landstafeln.

15
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:08,897
De har en skadad man på bordet.

16
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:37,229
Let's have a word from some of the air cruising formations.

17
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:42,752
It was my pleasure to have led the first heavy American bombardment mission over Berlin.

18
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:47,515
Lieutenant Durer, the navigator who led the mission into Germany that day.

19
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:49,637
Durer, how about some words from you?

20
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:56,060
Well, as you know it was tough navigating because of the almost impossible weather we had.

21
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,681
However, I'm glad now that you elected to go on hand.

22
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:04,263
I'm proud that our outfit could be the first one to make the trip.

23
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,786
Lieutenant Flagler, a bombardier up in the nose.

24
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:12,949
Colonel, the fighters made it pretty hot and the weather made it pretty cold, but I believe we hit the target.

25
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:13,270
Good.

26
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,973
And that's not all.

27
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:20,336
Pictures have just been released of the 12,000 pound bomb which is now being dropped on enemy targets.

28
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:22,758
Five and a half tons of factory buster.

29
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,280
And there are plenty of them.

30
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:34,877
Mr. Eden was greeted by his wife and officials of the foreign office.

31
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:41,298
He looks happy, as well he may.

32
00:03:58,944 --> 00:04:03,109
It doesn't seem so very long since any mission that went to Russia was almost foredoomed to fail.

33
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:05,711
But so much has happened since.

34
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:15,782
Let's hope those days of Anglo-Soviet mistrust and misunderstanding are gone for good.

35
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:22,348
Lady Louis Mountbatten received the king and queen and the two princesses when they went to see the special American show in aid of British service charities.

36
00:04:23,286 --> 00:04:26,247
Den allmänna kasten är helt avgörande från amerikansk armé.

37
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,990
Dessutom den berömda låtaren Irving Berlin.

38
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:39,357
Pakthusen gav en stor reception till den röda familjen- som följde Lady Louie Manbatten och lieutenant general Davids- som regerade amerikansk armé i det europeiska teatern.

39
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:47,810
Irving Berlin sang one of his own songs which is dedicated to the British fighting men with plenty of sentiment.

40
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:51,612
I like my coffee and rolls and he likes his tea but we're in there till we get to Germany when the job is done.

41
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,189
And the war is won.

42
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,050
We'll be clasping hands across the sea.

43
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:11,750
And then the high spot of the show.

44
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:13,350
The big minstrel number with its singing and dancing all-male chorus.

45
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:28,678
You wouldn't suspect a newsreel cameraman of having a soul, would you?

46
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:35,624
You wouldn't picture him as a humble student treading softly down the leafy lanes as a pilgrim to the shrine of an immortal.

47
00:06:35,644 --> 00:06:44,910
He holds the camera before him as he walks, and the scholarly stoop of his shoulders enables him to pass beneath the overhanging foliage.

48
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:49,533
In reverent awe, the traveler approaches the end of his hallowed journey.

49
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:55,468
The quiet, unspoiled surroundings with which our island story links the name of our great bard.

50
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:56,689
Stratford-on-Avon.

51
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:58,610
Stratford-on-Avon, you darn fool.

52
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:00,031
We're going to see Bernard Shaw.

53
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:04,694
Hello, Mr. Shaw.

54
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:10,098
This is the home in which Mr. George Bernard Shaw spent his 88th birthday.

55
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:18,269
Men han var rädd, några dagar innan han hade stannat med vänner någonstans i södra England.

56
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:21,050
Och det första jag såg var en bomb från Adolf Hitler som bröt mitt sovrum.

57
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:23,512
Jag hoppas att nästa dag ska jag få något mer lyckligt än det här.

58
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:24,353
Hejdå, hejdå, hejdå, hejdå.
