1
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,740
Hur lång är den?

2
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:27,201
Jag vet inte.

3
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,903
Hur lång är den?

4
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:30,305
Jag vet inte.

5
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:20,448
I'm starting off from here, flying to Newfoundland.

6
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:21,728
I'll refuel there then go on to London.

7
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:24,088
Well I hope to do the ocean cropping in something like 15-16 hours.

8
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:26,750
That's from New York all the way to London and it should be the fastest time.

9
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,151
This is my fourth ocean cropping so I'm becoming more or less used to it.

10
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,872
People have suggested it's rather late in the year but I think I'll be flying so high that I should be out of any ice or bad weather.

11
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:33,133
Anyway...

12
00:02:48,097 --> 00:02:49,997
I'll know in about a week's time whether that is so or not.

13
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:51,518
I'm starting off from New York, flying to Newfoundland.

14
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,479
I'll retool there quickly then go on to London.

15
00:02:52,498 --> 00:02:55,639
I don't quite know how long it will take from New York to London but I suppose something in the nature of 16 hours which would be the fastest time as yet.

16
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,800
This is my fourth ocean cropping so I'm getting quite used to it.

17
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:17,387
I've got a very fast aeroplane.

18
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:19,068
It's got a top speed of over 270 miles an hour.

19
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:20,368
And I've great confidence in it.

20
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:22,550
When I get to London, I'll probably stay there too.

21
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,510
Then I'll go right on to the Cape to try and beat the existing time to visit.

22
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:26,211
Which was put up in the South African Air Race last month.

23
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:28,193
I expect to be at the Cape something like 40 hours after...

24
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:46,284
I'm starting off from New York, flying to Newfoundland, refueling there quickly.

25
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:12,652
Jag väntar mig att åka till London om 15 timmar.

26
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,453
Jag har en väldigt snabb helikopter som inte flyttar mer än 250 km i en timme.

27
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:15,092
Det är en hel del speed.

28
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:15,854
Efter att jag kommer till London

29
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:40,209
Så, hej då!
