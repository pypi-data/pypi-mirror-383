1
00:00:01,885 --> 00:00:03,547
And every one of them seeks peace, freedom and social security.

2
00:00:03,567 --> 00:00:04,286
That aim is shared by all.

3
00:00:04,307 --> 00:00:05,067
By Sweden's prime minister.

4
00:00:05,086 --> 00:00:06,307
The leader of the Swedish Labour Party.

5
00:00:06,347 --> 00:00:07,387
Seen here relaxing on his way to work.

6
00:00:07,427 --> 00:00:08,327
It is shared by the man in the street.

7
00:00:08,348 --> 00:00:09,489
By the fisherman landing herring.

8
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,308
The national food of Sweden.

9
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:10,769
By women in the home.

10
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,420
I such lumberjacks as these who study at night.

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,219
All are agreed on this freedom.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,680
Children learn it as they curtsy to the teacher.

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,262
The glassblower, characteristic of one of Sweden's most skillful industries.

14
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:38,661
The builder balancing his bricks high above Stockholm.

15
00:00:38,682 --> 00:00:40,503
The secretary of the treasury, Mr. Ernest Bigfors, whose balance has to be good too.

16
00:00:57,107 --> 00:00:59,228
This working democracy has managed to give the country a high standard of living.

17
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:00,590
The citizen is taken care of from babyhood.

18
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:02,271
Into such a modern maternity home as this, the new citizen arrives.

19
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:02,631
Treatment is free.

20
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:03,411
Old age too has new anxieties.

21
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:04,593
Old age pensions in Sweden are adequate.

22
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:27,290
This good modern life has not been achieved without a struggle.

23
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:29,191
In houses like these, 60 years ago, the farm worker lived without security.

24
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:29,772
There were evictions.

25
00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:30,852
There were hard times for many.

26
00:01:30,893 --> 00:01:32,034
But during the 80s, socialism spoke in Sweden.

27
00:01:32,054 --> 00:01:32,734
The right to organize.

28
00:01:32,754 --> 00:01:33,015
Votes for all.

29
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:33,876
An eight-hour working day.

30
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:34,796
Such freedoms were fought for.

31
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:54,277
It was a bitter struggle.

32
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:54,998
Many gave up and migrated.

33
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:56,418
25,000 of them a year were leaving for America during the 20s.

34
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:58,980
Nevertheless, amid world wars and revolutions came a breakthrough to better things.

35
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:03,203
Labour's great spokesman was Hjalmar Branting, known throughout the world as a spokesman for the small nations at Geneva.

36
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,951
He was Sweden's first Labour prime minister.

37
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:24,693
Great trade depression of the 20s spread throughout the world and hit Sweden.

38
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:25,913
Labour demanded power to tackle unemployment.

39
00:02:25,954 --> 00:02:27,695
Herr Albin Hansson became prime minister in 1936.

40
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:28,576
He has remained in office ever since.

41
00:02:28,597 --> 00:02:30,377
He is seen here in council with King Gustav of Sweden.

42
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:51,843
As the political influence of labor grew, so did the trade unions.

43
00:02:51,903 --> 00:02:55,185
Meet Mr. August Lindberg, chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions.

44
00:02:55,205 --> 00:02:58,406
When he was 10 years old, he worked in a timber yard 13 hours a day.

45
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:00,746
The Federation vouches for something like 15,000 collective agreements.

46
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:03,926
And these agreements regulate practically the whole of Swedish industrial life.

47
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:23,688
Such centralized leadership does not however interfere with the responsibilities of local trade unions.

48
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:26,471
Every worker in fact is intensely interested in the problems of economic conditions.

49
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,092
Here in the provinces agricultural workers come together in a people's hall.

50
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:32,215
These workers are not yet highly organized for they belong to an industry of small units.

51
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,010
Their working day was not fixed by law until 1936, but progress is always being made.

52
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:57,574
Women workers, belonging to the federations of trade unions, are mostly found in the textile industry, where Swedish spruce becomes artificial silk and silk stockings.

53
00:03:57,594 --> 00:04:00,016
Strikes and labor troubles, with the one exception of the metal workers' strike in 1945,

54
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:21,468
Mediation by the government is also very effective in this conference of agricultural employers and workers under the chairmanship of a government official.

55
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,831
I Stockholm demonstrerar unionism sin kraft och celebrerar 50 år i koncerthallet, stadionet och i den berömda Stockholm City Hall.

56
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:48,833
I Brunsvik finns en skola som är en del av Federation of Trade Unions.

57
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,533
One of its main objects is to bring sociology and social sciences within the reach of the worker.

58
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:13,175
Into the beautiful province of Dalarna come scholarship holders from the various trade unions to take a three month course.

59
00:05:13,194 --> 00:05:15,196
At Brunsvik there is freedom to do anything, they say, except that which is ugly and stupid.

60
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:15,956
That is the only prohibition.

61
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:32,747
Jag märker att det är en av de ruller.

62
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:33,749
En politisk diskussion och debatt.

63
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:34,749
Every statement must be proved by fact.

64
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,490
Not only is this school objective but it is also broad minded.

65
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:38,391
The chairman of the employers association for instance comes to lecture every year.

66
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:38,793
At Bonners Beak

67
00:05:57,742 --> 00:06:00,122
There is a rather younger school belonging to the social democratic youth movement.

68
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:01,043
Here the courses are shorter.

69
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:02,562
One week you may find journalists there from labor papers.

70
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,362
There are 33 labor dailies in Sweden.

71
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:05,004
Another week there may be canvassers preparing for an election.

72
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:06,744
The Swedish labor movement has its own publishing house.

73
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:25,944
Book clubs and cheap editions in order to supply the worker with literary and topical books wherever he is working.

74
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:27,625
Labour has indeed launched its own literary offensive.

75
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:30,165
Amongst the most important writers in Sweden today are proletarian authors.

76
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,805
One of the best known, Eva Loh Johansson, has described the poor sharecroppers.

77
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:52,944
Moa Martinsson dividerar sin tid mellan farmor och skrivning och har skrivit fina böcker om arbetslösheter.

78
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:54,966
Den stora handelsskolan i Stockholm som började under depressionen, förlorar nu.

79
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:56,987
Hon förvandlar specialiserad träning för unga arbetare i alla typer av klasser.

80
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:15,153
800.000 kooperativa medlemmar är länkade tillsammans i head office av Sveriges konsumtionskorporation i Stockholm.

81
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:18,314
Kooperativen har hållit ner priserna och har gått in i den industriella livet i landet på en stor skala.

82
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:20,533
Här är Kornholmen, en äldre island nära Stockholm, helt ockupad av kooperativa industrier.

83
00:07:45,305 --> 00:07:47,305
Some of the famous Swedish crispbread is the product of the flour mill.

84
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:49,206
Here is the Luma lamp made by the famous Luma Girl.

85
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:55,069
This cooperative industry broke the international electric bulb monopoly in 1930.

86
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:57,350
And its most interesting product at the moment is fluorescent lamp.

87
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,130
A lamp for the home of the future.

88
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:19,863
Co-operativ spirit is well demonstrated in the China factory of Gustavsberg.

89
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:21,285
Special attention is paid to unmarried workers.

90
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:23,105
Orders are provided for bachelors and for young unmarried women.

91
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:46,573
Hållning har alltid varit en av stjärnorna i arbetslösheten.

92
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:48,455
Frihet att leva och få upp en familj i häftiga, moderna förhållanden.

93
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:49,395
En 12-dagar-vakation för varje svensk arbetare.

94
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,177
Det här, tillsammans med en kortare arbetsdag, är arbetslösheten.

95
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,597
Här går de, att träffa den bästa och bästa vägen.

96
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:53,498
Alla vattenvägar i Dalarna.

97
00:09:13,604 --> 00:09:14,504
Eller att ta båten till Gotland i Baltiken.

98
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:15,144
Den magiska staden av Bisby.

99
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:15,804
På västkast, framför Norra sjön.

100
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,034
De hittar solen, resten och energi.

101
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:45,475
Men för hans kvinna innebär en fredag ofta svårt arbete.

102
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:46,096
Frukter att välja, till exempel.

103
00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:47,755
Kvinnors klubbar har därför försvunnit regeringen att ge vakationer.

104
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:14,177
Prime minister himself was interested in the scheme.

105
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,539
In 1945, 4,000 housewives took these courses of rest and of education.

106
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,043
Music and dancing have a special traction for the young, and many trade unions have their own orchestras and choirs.

107
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:41,903
The very young receive more attention than anybody.

108
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:42,384
More playgrounds.

109
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:43,024
Better medical care.

110
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:43,524
More day nurses.

111
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:44,585
These are on the program for the future.

112
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,645
Sweden has a critically low birth rate.

113
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:48,927
And it is clear to everybody that family life can best be encouraged by such social measures.

114
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:51,470
Swedish youth must be educated to become good democrats and good internationalists.

115
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:12,081
Här är norska ungdomar som leder en skandinavisk grupp i Sverige.

116
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,642
Här är bilder från måndagsdemonstrationer i Sverige under kriget.

117
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:16,943
Bannarna pratar om Sveriges vilja att stödja sin frihet och integritet.

118
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:20,886
Svenska arbetare tittar fram till dagen när de träffar sina kompisar i alla länder och bär deras del i att säkerställa världens frihet.

119
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:40,123
Security in the home.

120
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:40,744
Prosperity and freedom.

121
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:41,845
That is the message of Swedish labour.
