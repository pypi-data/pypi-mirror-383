00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:10,513
Varsågod!

2
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:43,835
The mounted band of the lifeguards, the state trumpeters, precede the new Lord Mayor, Sir Percy Greenaway, on his arrival at the law courts to take his oath of allegiance before the Lord Chief Justice.

3
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:17,425
Var är ni?

4
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:52,552
Det är.

5
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,093
Now this is your joystick.

6
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:41,153
There is your throttle controlling your engine.

7
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:41,894
And there is your rudder bar.

8
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,855
And when I pass the joystick forward, my nose dips.

9
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,555
When I pull it back, it brings me back onto an even keel.

10
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:46,536
When I pull it right back, it raises my nose.

11
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:47,637
When I pass it to the left, my left wing drops.

12
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:49,399
When I pull it back, it brings the machine level again.

13
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:11,668
Du följer det?

14
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:11,788
Ja.

15
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:13,870
As you open your throttle, so you increase your speed.
