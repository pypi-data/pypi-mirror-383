00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:06,208
Välkomna!

2
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,330
My golly, they can shift.

3
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,431
Look at this fellow, it's as much as we can do to keep up with them ourselves.

4
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:53,733
Here they are, safe and sound in Brighton.

5
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:54,674
Oh, look at that, the old crocs.

6
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:12,156
Efter.

7
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:02,802
Från mellan fem och nio.

8
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,329
53 och 2 minuter 58.

9
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,050
3 minuter 58.

10
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:29,223
Varsågod.

11
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,396
Mr. Harland-Bernard, is the seat vacant?

12
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:07,119
Yes, yes.

13
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:39,194
Kära herrar, vad tänker ni om president Roswells val?

14
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:10,610
Nej, nej.
