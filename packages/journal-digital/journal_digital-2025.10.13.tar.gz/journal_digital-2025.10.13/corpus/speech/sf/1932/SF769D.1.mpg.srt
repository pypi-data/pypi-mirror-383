00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:41,732
Välkomna!

2
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:19,924
Tackar.

3
00:01:51,742 --> 00:02:16,748
The London Fire Brigade has always held the reputation of being one of the finest in the world.

4
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,949
And they're determined to justify their name.

5
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:22,557
This is one of their latest firefighting appliances.

6
00:02:22,578 --> 00:02:24,179
The tallest turntable fire escape as yet.

7
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,820
All steel, it reaches to a height of 100 feet and is entirely controlled by one man.

8
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,862
One of its devices is two-way conversation between the fireman at the top of the escape and the man at the control below.

9
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:59,686
The fireman up top has a microphone and a loud speaker fitted so that should he become enveloped in smoke during the height of the fire he can always talk to the man down below.

10
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:35,185
I.

11
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:14,830
Varsågod.

12
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:38,358
Här kommer de.

13
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:03,745
Ja, man kan det ju.

14
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:04,286
Ja, det kan jag.

15
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:04,687
Ja, det kan jag.

16
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:22,725
Åh!

17
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:50,737
Bra jobbat!

18
00:06:32,398 --> 00:06:32,560
Kom igen!

19
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:32,740
Kom igen!

20
00:07:01,492 --> 00:07:01,973
Vad tycker du om det här?

21
00:07:01,992 --> 00:07:02,613
Det håller kvinnorna på vägen.
