1
00:00:03,496 --> 00:00:10,561
For more than half a year the Lend-Lease Act has been in force and almost since the beginning of the war we've heard of American factories working for Britain.

2
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:15,124
We've followed with breathless anxiety the dangerous passage of these vital goods across the Atlantic.

3
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:18,786
But we haven't seen very much evidence with our own eyes of the stuff in Britain.

4
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:24,832
In the pictures that follow you will see just a small part of that war material made in United States factories.

5
00:00:25,032 --> 00:00:28,033
You will see how the stream of modern weapons is swelling to a flood.

6
00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:33,688
You will see an endless chain of steel fighting equipment flowing in to equip a new British offensive machine.

7
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:38,911
It's a pity these pictures can't be shown in Germany and to the countries now occupied and oppressed.

8
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:40,673
The effect would be revolutionary.

9
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:43,515
For all this, we have to thank one man.

10
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:48,439
At the start of the war, America was 3,000 miles away from our battlefields.

11
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:52,521
Her policy since the last great war had been to keep her nose out of European affairs.

12
00:00:52,962 --> 00:00:54,203
And you couldn't honestly blame her.

13
00:00:54,911 --> 00:01:00,554
Men amerikansk president hade den genus som förvånade Hitlers design för världskonkurs med omöjlig klarhet.

14
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:03,755
Han kände att om Britannien gick ner så skulle Amerika också gå ner.

15
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:10,177
Men han hade jobbet med att sälja den här förvånningen till miljoner av amerikaner som inte ville tro på det.

16
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:12,578
Det du ser nu är evidens av hur bra han lyckades.

17
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:16,280
Ja, vi i Britannien har bra skäl att säga tack, Mr. Roosevelt.

18
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:21,742
Inom en av depoterna av Royal Army Ordnance Corps får de och testar amerikanska fjällgångar och förutsättningar.

19
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:27,346
Tänk på hur många år vi har startat demokraterna med armat för krig.

20
00:01:27,447 --> 00:01:34,468
Och även om vi kände vad Hitler gjorde, var vi fullständigt nöjda med att hoppas på det bästa och låta honom gå igenom det.

21
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:40,189
Det är ganska tydligt att priset vi måste betala för frihet i framtiden är att hålla oss armade och starka.

22
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:45,210
Ingen tro, efter kriget kommer det att finnas flera ljusa händer som kommer att kalla för världsarmat.

23
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:49,912
Låt oss aldrig glömma att eftersom vi en gång lyssnat till den kriget, vi nästan slutar att existera som en fri nation.

24
00:01:49,932 --> 00:01:51,893
Nationer är som människor.

25
00:01:52,337 --> 00:01:56,679
It's a great ideal to have everybody disarmed so long as the world is populated by angels.

26
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:57,879
But nations are like people.

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,859
They have the same instincts.

28
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,641
Nations that want to start robbery don't try to rob the big fellow.

29
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:04,921
They pick on the small and the weak.

30
00:02:04,962 --> 00:02:06,462
Britons strength is growing daily.

31
00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:11,343
And so Britain is regaining her old place now as a leader among the nations of the world.

32
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:18,485
Thousands of Tommy Guns.

33
00:02:19,108 --> 00:02:22,674
Gästerna av ATS och armatörer testar och samlar i en annan stor depot.

34
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:26,240
Armatörer plus nära två miljoner män i homeguarden idag är bra.

35
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,507
Det ser ut som om det inte blir lång tid innan de alla har kraftig kraft.

36
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,169
Det här är den verkliga vikten.

37
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:27,097
Endless conveyers carry the war goods from ship to train, from train to lorry, from lorry to depot, from depot to underground store.

38
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:32,400
While the Soviet Union continues her magnificent fight, we have a welcome breathing space.

39
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,300
Time to build up a mighty arsenal.

40
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,641
Time to train our men in the use of the new weapons that are coming in every day and every night.

41
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:43,585
If the invasion does come, every German will stand a good chance of being blown sky high.

42
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:55,366
Detta är en liten knut till hur mycket hjälp som kommer över Atlantiken.

43
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:59,209
Mycket hjälp måste nu gå till Sovjetunionen, som idag behöver mer än oss.

44
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:02,710
Men med den här hjälpen och våra egna stora öppningar kan vi lägga oss på vägen till vänster.

45
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:05,411
Mr Churchill gav oss nyligen bra nyheter om Vattnet i Atlantiken.

46
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,010
Våra förlossningar är ner om två tredjedelar.

47
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,872
Varje flykt som kommer in till den här stora storhusen är en vänster.

48
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:24,939
Hitlers excursion against the Soviet has given us a chance we never dared to hope for.

49
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,401
Let's grab it with both hands for speedy victory.

50
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:36,608
In the meantime, once again, thanks Mr. Roosevelt.

51
00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:46,396
Lady Mac Robert of Doonside has sent 25,000 pounds to the Secretary of State for Air to go towards the cost of a bomber to carry on the work of her sons.

52
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:53,002
She has lost three sons in the air, two of them in action in the present war.

53
00:04:53,103 --> 00:05:01,824
In writing to the Secretary of State and asking him to accept her gift, Lady McRobert wrote, Let it be used where it is most needed.

54
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:04,305
May good fortune go with those who fly it.

55
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:08,206
I have no more sons to wear the badge or carry it in the fight.

56
00:05:09,305 --> 00:05:13,487
You are the crew who have been chosen to fly this sterling and to carry the McRobert crest.

57
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:16,848
And so the crew of the bomber take their places.

58
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:21,315
Reminding each other to be careful of our microphone in the interests of security or purity.

59
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:31,858
Be careful what you say, old boy, because they're listening to you.

60
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:37,800
I say you're taking off now, are you?

61
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,180
Okay.

62
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:43,502
McRoberts reply takes off for Germany to carry on the fight against the enemies of Britain.

63
00:05:44,382 --> 00:05:46,363
A very proud and gallant lady carries on.

64
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:55,886
This is the top spirit again reflected as it was when other ladies refused to weep while Germans wrecked the humblest of our homes.

65
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:59,067
Our Prime Minister says many memorable things.

66
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:03,930
One recent pronouncement of his will certainly be remembered proudly in this part of Britain.

67
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:05,490
Tyneside is doing more than it's bid.

68
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:12,394
During his weekend Yorkshire tour Mr Churchill went to Hull to see the damage suffered in that city from air bombardment.

69
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:15,055
Here he was accompanied by Australia's representative Sir Earl Page.

70
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,182
På nästa dag gick primärministern till Sheffield.

71
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:21,483
Och den här andra staden som vet allt om blitzar var i verklighetsmöte.

72
00:06:21,504 --> 00:06:30,309
Visningen blev kvar.

73
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:33,511
Och nyheterna om att Mr. Churchill drar genom gatorna är den typen av nyheter som sprids.

74
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,651
I Sheffield var munitionfaktorerna besökt och här igen var välkomnande.

75
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:50,970
Of course you can't please everybody, but if you can get cheers like this in Britain, it doesn't really matter if they're hissing a bit in Tokyo.

76
00:06:55,793 --> 00:07:01,175
Under the Statue of Liberty, 1,200 young Americans are marching.

77
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:04,276
The latest batch of recruits to the United States Air Forces.

78
00:07:05,137 --> 00:07:10,480
And while youth responded so generously, Roosevelt told Congress about America's $56 billion victory program.

79
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:21,442
to increase our production rate of airplanes so rapidly that in this year 1942 we shall produce 60,000 planes.

80
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:32,831
The rate of increase will be maintained, continued, so that next year, 1943, we shall produce 125,000 airplanes including

81
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,274
A hundred thousand combat plane.

82
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:01,406
Second, to increase our production rate of tanks so rapidly that in this year, 1942, we shall produce 45,000 tanks.

83
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:33,332
and to continue that increase so that next year 1943 we shall produce 75,000 tanks to increase our production rate of merchant ships so rapidly that in this year 1942 we shall build 8 million deadweight tons as compared with a 1941

84
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:37,448
Completed production of 1.100.000.

85
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:49,539
These figures and similar figures for a multitude of other implements of war will give the Japanese and the Nazis a little idea of just what they accomplished in the attack at Pearl Harbor.

86
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:19,009
American armed forces must be used at any place in all the world where it seems advisable to engage the forces of the enemy.

87
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:25,114
In some cases these operations will be defensive in order to protect key positions.

88
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:36,700
In other cases these operations will be offensive in order to strike at the common enemy with a view to his complete ensufflement and eventual total defeat.

89
00:09:40,477 --> 00:09:45,441
Det är en av militarismen i Tjärmen och Italien och Japan.

90
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:15,046
Most certainly.

91
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:24,432
We shall not settle for less.

92
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:26,875
First meeting of the racing season in Iraq.

93
00:10:27,096 --> 00:10:30,538
And the first big social function since the unsuccessful revolt of Rashid Ali.

94
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:32,919
Picturesque as any race course in the world.

95
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,642
But a surprisingly western touch is the tote.

96
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,041
All the officials, including the starter, are British.

97
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:53,284
Dash it all, they couldn't be anything else.

98
00:10:53,325 --> 00:11:00,610
The meeting celebrated the end of Ramadan, the orthodox time of fasting.

99
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:03,854
Now for a sideshow, Indian troops have discarded their uniforms to dance.

100
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:05,695
It looks as though someone discarded a necklace.

101
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:15,231
These dancers look rather amusing to us, but the dancers can also fight, so they say in Africa.
