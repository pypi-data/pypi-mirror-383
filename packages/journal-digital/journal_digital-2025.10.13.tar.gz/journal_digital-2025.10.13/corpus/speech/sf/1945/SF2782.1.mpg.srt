00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:56,669
Those forty little ounces Gotta last me all the week I gotta cut out on my jelly It takes sugar to make it sweet I'm gonna steal all your jelly baby And rob you of your meat I got duration blues Blue as I can be Oh me I've got duration blues

21
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:30,092
I like to wake up in the morning With my jelly by my side Since rationing started baby You just take your stuff and hide They're reduced to my meat and sugar And rubber's disappearing fast You can't ride no more with papa Cause Uncle Sam wants my gas I got the ration blues Blue as I can be For me For me
