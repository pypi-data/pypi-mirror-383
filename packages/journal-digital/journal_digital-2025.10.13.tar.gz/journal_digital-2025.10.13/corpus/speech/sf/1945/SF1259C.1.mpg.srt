00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:11,429
General de Gaulle i en recent speech in the Paris region with the winter in its most severe spoke frank words.

2
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:17,533
Victory is assured at the end of our labors, but at this moment nature herself seems to have turned against us.

3
00:00:17,574 --> 00:00:22,917
Five months after liberation, life in France is unbelievably hard through lack of all normal facilities.

4
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:27,782
On top of this have come floods to ravage and isolate vast areas.

5
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,583
A frost to stop even the barges bringing coal along the canals.

6
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:35,029
Kommunikationen var mer än minskad med tanke på den krigsbrytande situationen i landet.

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:44,372
Men den här vädret har gjort det här rådet omöjligt.

8
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:46,432
Grazingslandet har en thick white carpet.

9
00:00:46,453 --> 00:00:47,734
Kropparna är beredda i snö.

10
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:54,085
The railway points are frozen hard.

11
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:55,707
The engines have no coal.

12
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:59,466
And the people of Paris as a result have nothing to heat their homes and less food.

13
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:01,667
The markets, the famous isle, are empty.

14
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:08,709
Through lack of transport, the riches of the earth cannot be brought even a score of miles to feed the hungry mouths of the population.

15
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:11,590
To run transport you need coal or petrol.

16
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:13,650
But to get coal or petrol you need transport.

17
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:15,150
And so the vicious circle goes round.

18
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:26,096
Men även i sina egna tragiska situationer, minskar pariserna de större misslyckanden av normandens folk, som fortfarande hade att existera i den här röda staden och byn, för här har monsterna av krig gått mer nära.

19
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:28,018
Det som är kvar i sin väg är en tragisk travesti av moderna livet.

20
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,430
Very often families have not even a roof over their heads.

21
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:49,555
And yet they live on and hope on and think of their sons or friends or allies who are fighting, maybe dying, in the mud and the snow of the front.

22
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:52,436
Here in their homes they have no heat, no light, even no water.

23
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:54,257
The oil in the wheels of civilization has dried up.

24
00:01:54,277 --> 00:01:55,658
And the wheels will only start to turn again when all this is over.

25
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:56,058
When the war is won.

26
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:12,187
And the greatest duty of everyone is not just to wait for that day, but to hasten its coming.

27
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:40,106
In the mining country in northern France, derelict flying bomb launching ramps.

28
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:43,427
Today the playground of children who've known no toys.

29
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:45,487
An ironical comment on our age.

30
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:55,431
In the now quiet countryside, the layers from which these infernal machines took their course serve to remind us that another stage has been reached in the development of civilization.

31
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:59,252
An automaton can bring hell itself to human beings living 200 miles away.

32
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:13,747
The immediate danger from V1s may have largely passed, but it is a sobering thought to think of the effect its very invention could have on the future strategy and political decisions of the nations of the world.

33
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:19,092
People in southern England know only too well the sound and appearance of this monstrous weapon.

34
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:34,074
Den som visar sig i den här otroliga bilden har aldrig nått sitt mål, för där uppstår snabbt sin död.

35
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:46,837
Hunt är över chaneln, och det är inte lång tid innan en människa har skjutit ett dödsblås till sin robotadvokat.

36
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:08,361
Throughout the occupation the Berlier factories worked for the Germans and suffered severe damage by allied bombardment.

37
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:15,008
The French minister of industrial production recently visited the factories to see for himself the results of an interesting experiment.

38
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:17,572
Immediately after the liberation Monsieur Berlier was arrested.

39
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,754
But that didn't in any way stop work in the factories.

40
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:20,154
Far from it.

41
00:04:21,954 --> 00:04:28,418
In the proprietors enforced absence the business has been directed by the staff and they've shown that they're prepared to take the responsibility.

42
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:34,483
Under the new regime the engineers, the overseers and the rest of the staff are working side by side in perfect harmony.

43
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:38,225
First of all to repair the damage to the repair shops and the machines.

44
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:45,310
And they've given up their Saturday afternoons and Sundays in order to get output started with the minimum delay.

45
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,452
This is a bold idea and its development will be watched with interest.

46
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:59,375
The collective effort of these men, working in a common cause for the common good, with the skilled experience behind them, has achieved great things and surmounted great obstacles.

47
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:09,786
For today, the Berlier factories, without Monsieur Berlier, are again in full production and contributing under their new management to Francis' war effort.

48
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:50,355
Frans har dyr behov av allt som hennes fabriker kan producera.

49
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:56,177
Och successen av Berlier-experimentet visar hur ett av de stora problemen av politisk och ekonomisk förändring kan förändras genom kärlek och determination.

50
00:05:56,237 --> 00:06:00,300
I stället för de svårigheter som den möter varje gång, är det franska regeringen som inte förlorar sin stora koloniska mission.

51
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:17,324
Världens regerande regeringschef avgör öppningsceremonin för en ny väg som kommer från Tunis till Casablanca.

52
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,384
Det har gjorts under kriget och är en enorm tillgång till kommunikationen i Nordafrika.

53
00:06:50,317 --> 00:06:52,560
Från Morocco kommer nyheter om en annan stor franska uppgift.

54
00:06:53,913 --> 00:07:02,637
General Katrou attends a ceremony at the new Afud dam about 60 miles from Casablanca in the presence of his majesty the sultan Sidi Mohammed.

55
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:10,720
This was one of General Katrou's last public acts on African soil before taking leave for Moscow where he's been appointed French ambassador.

56
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:30,086
Det franska regeringen är stolt över det här stora arbetet, vilket visar ett annat steg i utvecklingen som Frans har tillverkat till Marokko.

57
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:35,014
De natala arbetarna är justerbart stolt över att de undersöker resultaten av deras arbete.

58
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:53,367
This immense dam, completed in spite of the innumerable difficulties of wartime, will create electrical supply for a great part of Morocco and permit irrigation of vast tracts of territory.

59
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:10,526
Frans hjälper sin krig och den kommer med hjälp av Frans, som skickar meddelande till västerfronten.

60
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:35,442
The resident general of France in Morocco recently visited his men, the famous Moroccan goons, at the front in Alsace, where their fabulous reputation as tough fighters has been clearly upheld.

61
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:39,625
The soldiers of the French Empire are today making an invaluable effort, fighting at the side of their French and allied comrades.

62
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,485
Great countries have a right to be proud of their empires.
