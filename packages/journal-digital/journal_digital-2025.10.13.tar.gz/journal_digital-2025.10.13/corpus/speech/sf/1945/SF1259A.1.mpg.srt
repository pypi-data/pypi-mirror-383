1
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,432
May the 8th, 1945.

2
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:16,734
The day of victory in Europe and scenes of thankful rejoicing in the heart of the Empire's capital which have been echoed throughout the world.

3
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:22,054
Trafalgar Square is a rallying point for many of the happy thousands who come to welcome peace.

4
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:57,082
Hickory Circus var bara ett stort stort stjärn av facer.

5
00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:14,854
Från morgonen till klockan på natten är det många som åker till Buckingham Palace– –för att berätta om vår kring och kvinna– –som har deltagit med deras folk om kriget.

6
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:22,526
They stand on the bomb-scarred balcony of their home, which has suffered like so many thousands of others in this our land.

7
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:04,040
From number 10 Downing Street the Prime Minister makes the momentous announcement for which the world had been waiting.

8
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:08,663
Yesterday morning at 2.41 a.m.

9
00:03:09,544 --> 00:03:25,473
at General Eisenhower's headquarters General Jodl the representative of the German High Command and of Grand Admiral Dönitz the designated head of the German state signed the act

10
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:31,604
of unconditional surrender of all German land, sea and air forces in Europe to the allied expeditionary forces and simultaneously to the Soviet high command.

11
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:35,727
Hostilities will end officially at one minute after midnight tonight Tuesday the 8th of May.

12
00:03:55,861 --> 00:04:03,746
We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing.

13
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:06,387
Today is victory in Europe day.

14
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:11,490
Tomorrow will also be victory in Europe day.

15
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:17,713
But let us not forget for a moment the toils and efforts that lie ahead.

16
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:24,516
Japan with all her treachery and greed remains unsubdued.

17
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:37,713
The injuries she has inflicted upon Great Britain, the United States and other countries and her detestable cruelties call for justice and retribution.

18
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:46,815
We must now devote all our strength and resources to the completion of our tasks both at home and abroad.

19
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,216
Advance Britannia.

20
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,098
Long live the cause of freedom.

21
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:53,738
God save the king.

22
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:59,387
I det här momentet av tackgivningen talar hans majestätare till hans folk och hans krigsforcer runt om i världen.

23
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:01,367
I dag ger vi tack till Gud för en stor belöning.

24
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:07,870
Från vårt empat, den äldsta kapitalstaden, var vi alla bättrade och var aldrig för en moment skämtade eller förvånade.

25
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:35,733
Speaking from London, I ask you to join with me in that act of thanksgiving.

26
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:47,915
Germany, the enemy who drove all Europe into war, has been finally overcome.

27
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:53,536
In the Far East, we have yet to deal with the Japanese

28
00:05:55,274 --> 00:06:01,139
Det är ett bestämt och kraftfullt krig.

29
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:07,404
Till det ska vi vända oss med all möjlighet och med alla våra resurser.

30
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:21,216
Men vid den här tiden, när den drömmande mörkret av kriget har gått långt från våra händer och hem i de här isländerna,

31
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:39,822
We may at last make one pause for thanksgiving and then turn our thoughts to the tasks all over the world which peace in Europe brings with it.

32
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:46,944
First, and let us remember those who will not come back.

33
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:50,805
Their constancy and courage in battle

34
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:59,774
Deres sacrifice and endurance in the face of a merciless enemy.

35
00:06:59,814 --> 00:07:02,997
Let us remember the men in all the services.

36
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:12,624
The women in all the services who have laid down their lives.

37
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:16,067
We have come to the end of our tribulation.

38
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:21,331
And they are not with us at the moment of our rejoicing.

39
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:25,855
En större och större kraft rör sig runt paletet.

40
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,461
Och på balkonet kommer familjen med vår prime minister själv.

41
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:13,504
The skies over London are lit by the joyous lights that work so hard and so long.
