The final battlefield of the Third Reich, the city of Berlin, now lies ruined from end to end after the final annihilating Russian assault added to our long-term bombing from the West.

00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:45,256
The nerve center of what was once the greatest military machine on earth has finally become a victim of the powers which were to have become the slaves of Nazi domination.

16
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:05,804

17
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:07,125
This unconditional surrender has been achieved by teamwork.

18
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,206
Teamwork not only among all the Allies participating, but among all the services.

19
00:03:27,425 --> 00:03:28,205
land, sea and air.

20
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:36,967
To every subordinate that has been in this command of almost five million allies, I owe debt of gratitude that can never be repaid.

21
00:03:38,748 --> 00:03:47,191
The only repayment that can be made to them is a deep appreciation and lasting gratitude of all free citizens of all the United Nations.

22
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,512
Following the supreme commander's message, army signalers joyfully send out the news to their comrades all over Europe.

23
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:10,413

25
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:00,523
One of them only went.

26
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:18,408
It was the same story of wildly cheering affectionate crowds greeting the man who had led them through the dark days and the days of triumph with the courage and strength which has won the acclaim of the world.

27
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:22,689
A most pleasant duty for the premier was the visiting of the ambassadors of our allies, first of all France.

28
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:49,213
The American ambassador Mr. Winant gives a warm welcome to the premier who was accompanied by his daughter Mary.

00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:54,817

32
00:06:25,322 --> 00:06:33,425
Amid de skadade händerna av de brittiska människorna, som så bra har avstått de många skräck och svårigheter av totalt krig, har spiriten blivit född, vilket kommer att säkerställa en stark och hållbar frihet i Europa, och i slutändan hela världen.

33
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:38,646
De flesta av de flesta på VE-dagen var i Whitehall, när primärministern oerhört pratade med de flesta som samlade sig för att stödja honom.

34
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:53,677
Det här är din vikten, sa han till dem.

35
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,680
Och de här ordet kommer länge att bli minskade av de som har hört dem prata.
