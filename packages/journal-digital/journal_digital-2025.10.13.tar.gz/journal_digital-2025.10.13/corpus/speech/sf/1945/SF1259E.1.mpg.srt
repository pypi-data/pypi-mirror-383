00:00:01,471 --> 00:00:09,615
In the garden of number 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister says goodbye to his old war cabinet and at the same time welcomes the ministers of his new caretaker government.

2
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:27,143
The French nation showed its gratitude to Field Marshal Montgomery during his recent visit to Paris, where General de Gaulle decorated him with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour.

3
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:46,033
At a small house at Lüneburg, Heinrich Himmler, Gestapo chief and once the terror of Europe, lies dead by his own hand shortly after being captured by our troops.

4
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:55,755
The veteran Lancaster bomber Ares is home again after a hazardous polar flight to locate the true position of the magnetic north pole involving a round trip of more than 17,000 miles.

5
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:58,234
Congratulations to the RAF on a splendid piece of air navigation.

6
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:09,837
Ever since flying began, the airmen's greatest enemy has been fog.

7
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:16,519
That deadly menace which at one time was responsible for more losses over British airfields than were caused by flak over Germany.

8
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:23,962
The Prime Minister was gravely concerned at these casualties and immediately went into action.

9
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:31,543
He instructed Mr. Jeffrey Lloyd of the Petroleum Warfare Department to put in hand every possible experiment to keep airfields free from fog.

10
00:01:32,313 --> 00:01:36,956
Resultatet var operation FIDO, som betyder Fog Intensive Dispersion.

11
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:46,004
Agenten använde var att bränna petroleum, och FIDO-systemet gjorde det möjligt att hålla hela aerodromen klart för operationer, även i den djupaste foggen.

12
00:01:46,703 --> 00:01:53,989
Vid slutet av året har många liv, amerikansk och brittisk, redan blivit rädda av FIDO, men testtiden har fortfarande att komma.

13
00:01:58,688 --> 00:02:05,313
Christmas 1944, Brunsteds breakthrough in the Ardennes, a desperate offensive which might change the whole course of the war.

14
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:12,276
A pall of fog lay heavily over Britain at a time when every bomber was urgently needed to smash the German lines of supply.

15
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:16,818
Operation Fido had already proved its value, but this was its greatest task.

16
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,462
Heavily laden bombers must be able to take off in great numbers in one of the worst fogs known for years.

17
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:26,264
Pathfinders must leave their bases to guide the bombers to their targets.

18
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:49,031
They did take off and very soon tons of high explosive were helping to shatter Germany's last great offensive.

19
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:52,933
Still flying blind through the fog, the bombers returned home.

20
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:59,396
The morale of their crews is high in the knowledge that their mission will end in a safe landing guaranteed by Fido.

21
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:07,086
Plane after plane comes in between the long lines of flame which have meant all the difference between life and death for so many pilots and their crews.

22
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:41,060
Like its counterparts, Mulberry and Pluto, Operation Fido is another triumph for its British creators and for the stimulating drive of Mr. Churchill.

23
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:20,273
On the aerodrome where Fido was first installed, Mr. Jeffrey Lloyd visits the Pathfinder chief, Air Vice Marshal Bennett, who pays tribute on behalf of the Royal Air Force.

24
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:24,055
And now, as you see, the public are being told the secret of Fido.

25
00:04:24,136 --> 00:04:32,242
And I think the public should know that Fido, in this war, has saved over 10,000 aircrew lives.

26
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:39,209
Moreover, Fido has made it possible to carry out operations in base weather which would have

27
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:40,206
stopp.

28
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:45,728
En exempel av det var när Rundstedt försökte bräcka igenom den offensiva idén.

29
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:50,610
Bommaruppgången var nödvändig, hård uppgång, och rådgivarna behövdes markera.

30
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:53,449
Men rådgivarnas grundläggande väder var färdiga.

31
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,692
Rådgivarna var rädda eftersom Fido gjorde det möjligt för rådgivarna att ta sig ut och landa

32
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:10,220
in spite of this thick fog.

33
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:22,944
Moreover it's been of tremendous value to crews returning from operations to know that they could get down at their bases regardless of the weather.

34
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:33,230
Bomber Command are extremely grateful to the Ministry of Petroleum Warfare for having produced such a magnificent British invention.

35
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,771
The pathfinders in particular who have mastered

36
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:45,201
Target Weather, I'm very grateful to you for having made it possible for them to master base weather.

37
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:55,406
This is the most thrilling and satisfactory job I've handled during the war because it saves the lives of our airmen, especially the pathfinders who are the spearhead of bomber command.

38
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:57,346
Mr. Churchill started it all.

39
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:11,076
And we could never have done the job without his powerful backing right through.

40
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:19,144
And gentlemen, if any of you are flying civil planes after the war, it will mean a good deal to you and your passengers then.

41
00:06:19,223 --> 00:06:26,531
Out of the needs of war has come a masterly invention which will ensure the safety of our future air routes throughout the world.
