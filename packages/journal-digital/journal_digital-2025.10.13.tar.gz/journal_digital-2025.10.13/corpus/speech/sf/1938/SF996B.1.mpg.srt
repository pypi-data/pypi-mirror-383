1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:02,511
Välkomna!

2
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:49,753
Hej då!

3
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:03,247
Ja.

4
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:03,306
Ja.

5
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:46,968
Jag kommer aldrig igen.

6
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,279
The lesson is from the first book of Kings, chapter 5.

7
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,822
And behold, I purpose to build an house under the name of the Lord my God, that the Father spake unto David my God, saying, My son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy womb, he shall build an house under my name.

8
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,512
And the king commanded and they brought great stones, costly stones and huge stones to lay the foundation of the house.

9
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,492
Nisi dovidus edificaveritum.

10
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:03,452
In vamma mamma deo, fie edificad reo.

11
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:04,213
Nisi dovidus custodierit civitatum.

12
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:22,470
Frustra mig till att vi kustar in er.

13
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:23,571
Vad om vi är svåra att se ljuset sången?

14
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,072
Vad om vi måste anställa er till att vi skadar oss för er?

15
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:43,072
Du delar inte mig, visst, du är så god.

16
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:44,173
Värd dig, herre, värd dig, jag skapar dig för mig.

17
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:45,055
Värd dig, frukt, frukt, värd dig för mig.

18
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:59,733
Sigur salliter i vallopågärning, sigar bibliet ur sovnum, deatros virvim pläget eviterium summe sipsi.

19
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,608
Along sheer walls and high stone cliffs, a steep and winding roadway has been blasted into the mountaintop.

20
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:21,848
Here is a natural testing ground, and water testing ground.

21
00:07:42,115 --> 00:07:44,538
It took the first man who climbed the peak two days to reach the top.

22
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:45,557
Today it takes the average motorist an hour.

23
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:46,079
And they're off!

24
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,059
Hammett is over the mark first.

25
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,759
Closely followed by Cimino.

26
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:48,259
And then by Schultz.

27
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,521
The course is lined on every side with spectators attracted by the promise of thrills galore.

28
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,081
As they scale the heights.

29
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:51,822
Schultz takes the lead.

30
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:52,382
Closely followed by Cimino.

31
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:53,343
Oh, look at those boys dig in on the turn.

32
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:54,064
And how those V8s hug the roads.

33
00:08:08,812 --> 00:08:13,978
You know, most of the races run in second or low gear, with motors turning as fast as 4200 revolutions a minute.

34
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:15,959
At times, the cars reach a speed of 60 miles an hour.

35
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:25,509
The skilled drivers shift gears at the turn from second to low speed without lifting a foot off the accelerator.

36
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:29,552
Every minute, every step of the way is a searching test for engine, car and driver.

37
00:08:30,072 --> 00:08:34,355
It takes plenty of skill and plenty of nerve to keep the accelerator on the floorboard.

38
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:40,640
Stems straighten out after the hairpin turns and pull up a grade that keeps the driver looking straight through the windshield at blue sky.

39
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:43,964
The course follows a route 12 miles and 2200 feet long.

40
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:47,346
The finish line is more than 5000 feet higher than the starting point.

41
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:52,192
Det här är testet för carburatör och koldioxidsystem.

42
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:55,193
Tänk dig att röra ditt bil i full trottel på 12 mil.

43
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:58,554
Följa varje steg av vägen i tredje eller låga styrkor.

44
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:01,856
På höga nivåer växer vatten mer snabbt.

45
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:05,278
Och ännu inte några av dessa Ford hade problem med överhållning.

46
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:12,801
Det här är en reserv i temperatur och kontroll som tillverkar att när man rör sig, rör sig mer än 4200 gånger per minut, enligt Takamata Rekord.

47
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:13,780
Och det är verkligen rörande.

48
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:19,586
Boss Hammond, youngest of the three drivers of the Ford V8, finished first.

49
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:22,086
Covering the course in 19 minutes, 25 and 7, the driver sees snow on rocks and the roadway.

50
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:23,788
And once again, the Ford V8 demonstrates its speed, stamina and power.

51
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:23,967
Hammond!

52
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:24,587
Hammond is the winner!

53
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:25,947
And not far behind him is Cimino.

54
00:09:26,008 --> 00:09:31,070
And bringing up the rear, only because he went off the road onto the rocks to avoid hitting a spectator, Schultz, nine times winner of the climb, comes in last.

55
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,289
But still well ahead of the 1933 record.

56
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:52,142
The three drivers parade their mounts in front of the observation tower as a gesture of triumph over Old Man Mountain.

57
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:53,703
No wonder they are proud of themselves and their cars.

58
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:54,325
Oh, it was a great race.

59
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:54,946
Ah, the victors smile.

60
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:57,389
And here are the fruits of victory in the shape of a huge silver cup offered by Spencer Penrose.

61
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:07,839
The cup becomes the property of the 1934 winner until some faster car comes along.

62
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:10,863
And when that day comes, we are ready to venture the prediction that it will be another Ford V8.

63
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:12,284
Still the fastest, finest and most dependable...
