1
00:00:30,606 --> 00:00:32,426
It's morning at Drottningholm.

2
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:39,450
The swans are taking their morning swim and the kings sheep are grazing in the soft meadows.

3
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:46,508
The beautiful castle, the summer residence of the king of Sweden, glistens in the morning sun.

4
00:00:46,908 --> 00:00:53,911
It's a little after nine, and the king's already at breakfast, making his own tea to be sure it's just the right strength.

5
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:58,633
The rest of his breakfast consists of soft boiled eggs and toast.

6
00:00:59,432 --> 00:01:04,956
The king is a busy man, with a busy day ahead of him, so he needs a reasonably early start.

7
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:08,537
Even if he has kept late hours the night before,

8
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:10,969
He's always punctual at breakfast.

9
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:18,894
And if he's going hunting or fishing, he gets up at six in order to spend as much of the day as possible in the open.

10
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:20,855
He's a great sportsman.

11
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:24,817
But today is an ordinary work day.

12
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:32,022
And the valet de chambre, when he comes in with the morning papers, finds his royal master at his desk.

13
00:01:33,283 --> 00:01:37,825
A businessman always reads the news carefully enough in his favorite newspaper.

14
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:50,099
But think how much more carefully a king must read the news in all the papers to get a clear picture of current events, which, as we know, can change from one hour to the next.

15
00:01:51,159 --> 00:02:05,031
After he has finished, he and his attendants, the Lord Chamberlain and an aide, get into his car to drive to Stockholm, about 12 miles away, where further duties of state await him, among them a cabinet meeting.

16
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:12,975
The palace guard comes to attention in honor of the army's commander in chief as the royal car drives through the park.

17
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:23,784
The king will be coming very shortly through these handsomely carved and painted doors in the royal palace in Stockholm on his way from his own apartment to the council chambers.

18
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:27,448
It's a long walk through many beautiful rooms and halls.

19
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:35,895
Here he enters the gallery of the Bernadotts where his ancestors looked down upon him out of their heavy gilt frames.

20
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:50,580
He has been through these rooms many times before and as always, precisely at the appointed hour, his majesty, King Gustav V, passes the bowing secretaries in the ante-room to enter the council chamber where the cabinet is assembled.

21
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,682
With a friendly smile and nod, he strides into the room and shakes hands with his cabinet ministers.

22
00:02:56,903 --> 00:03:06,430
Bagge, Dumö, Eriksson, Sköld, Wigfors, Ramstorp, and the prime minister.

23
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:10,367
They exchange a few words before the meeting is convened.

24
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:13,631
Someone inquires perhaps about his majesty's health.

25
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,211
Another his hunting luck.

26
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:18,215
Someone else may mention a recent game of tennis.

27
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:21,997
But there's business to take care of.

28
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:32,287
So the members of the cabinet take their places around a large table laden with books of law, statute rolls and important papers.

29
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:34,568
The crown in council.

30
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:41,615
Den högsta administrativa kraften i landet, regeringen och rådgivarna börjar jobba.

31
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:54,146
Medan de jobbar är regeringens lunch förberedd.

32
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:56,750
Låt oss se vad som krävs i regeringens klocka.

33
00:03:58,403 --> 00:04:04,048
There's Monsieur Robert, the king's French chef, hurrying in his own gallic way to get the lunch ready.

34
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:11,454
The king likes fish, and Monsieur is putting the finishing touches to a delicious dish called Baltic Herring a la Herningsholm.

35
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:19,740
Mmm, it's too bad the taste film hasn't been invented yet, because to judge from the chef's contented look, it must be good.

36
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,201
Yes, it's ready.

37
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:25,004
And there it goes, off to the king's apartment.

38
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,206
But wait a minute, where's the music coming from?

39
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:34,740
Oh yes of course it's the changing of the guard in the outer courtyard of the palace.

40
00:04:35,982 --> 00:04:38,742
Let's join the other spectators and watch for a moment.

41
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:39,499
Kort efter lunchen är det tid som kringen ger publiken.

42
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:47,839
Det finns alltid en stadig ström av besökare som går upp på den stora staden och alla har samma ärende.

43
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,040
Att prata med kringen.

44
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:56,117
Today there are so many, they will have time to see only a few.

45
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:05,971
For instance, there's the foreign secretary, and in conversation with him, the governor general.

46
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,281
Och här är Lord Chamberlain i väntan, för att förklara att hans majestät ska få till regeringssekreteraren.

47
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,440
Han visar hans excellens till skrivboken.

48
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:24,504
Som ni kan föreställa er, har regeringssekreteraren mycket att säga till kungen, för en av sina tjänster är att hålla kungen informerad om den förändrade politiska situationen utomlands.

49
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:30,627
Regeringssekreteraren, som också är Sveriges högsta politisk officiell,

50
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:37,528
has many things to discuss too, and judging from appearances, the conversation interests both of them.

51
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:48,351
Here's another visitor, the first commissioner of Sweden, and incidentally a fine poet, Gunnar Maskall Silverstolpe.

52
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:56,514
He has a rare find to show the king, who is an enthusiastic collector of silver, and who especially likes the large, massive tankards.

53
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:04,773
The King, known to sports fans as Mr. G, is almost as famous in the tennis world as Bill Tilden.

54
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:09,014
He is and has been for many years the white sports Swedish ambassador.

55
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:14,415
He still plays a good game and is an excellent subject for his footman's 16mm film camera.

56
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:18,177
How many of you think you'll be able to do this at the age of 85?

57
00:07:18,576 --> 00:07:19,317
I'm only asking.

58
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:23,619
The King is light on his feet and he drives the ball over the net with plenty of force.

59
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:28,040
Mellan spel, en mörk, men undervisande ungdom, frågar för sin autograf.

60
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,221
Och får den!

61
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:31,824
Vänta tills barnen i skolan ser det.

62
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:41,593
Kringen ser ganska glad ut för det också.

63
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:46,399
När kringen kommer hem efter en timme hård spel, hittar han räddning i bränsle.

64
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:59,232
He has done this sort of handwork for many years, perhaps because while he works the Venetian pattern, his favorite, he has time and leisure to think.

65
00:08:00,132 --> 00:08:06,456
At the moment he's probably thinking of the things he would like to discuss with the crown prince and princess today.

66
00:08:06,997 --> 00:08:08,298
He's expecting them for tea.

67
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:18,386
The crown prince and princess arrive from their castle in Ulriksdal and pass through the blue room to the drawing room where the tea table is set.

68
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:27,398
Där meeting is a cheerful one father and son shake hands heartily and the crown prince inquires.

69
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:29,079
How are you, dad?

70
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:43,128
No servants are present at tea time, as this is a family gathering, and they wish to speak of personal matters without being disturbed.

71
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:48,451
The crown princess always acts as hostess and passes the cakes Monsieur Robert has baked.

72
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,293
Head of the family sits and speaks of family affairs with his oldest son and successor.

73
00:08:58,057 --> 00:09:02,340
A lot of things are bound to happen in any large family, and so it is with the kings.

74
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:11,467
If father and son come up against a problem, they turn to the crown princess who smiles and answers quite to their satisfaction.

75
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:24,946
The Crown Prince describes some recent military exercises, and while the Crown Princess is telling an amusing story about the King's great-grandchildren, the camera shows us the portrait of the King's beloved wife, the late Queen Victoria.

76
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:31,567
The King enjoys the stories about his great-grandchildren, and his eyes shine with interest as he listens and comments.

77
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:34,707
Yes, he's a fine great-granddad.

78
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:39,048
But there are still official duties to be fulfilled.

79
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,628
This one is the opening of a national defense show.

80
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:49,633
Upon his arrival, he shakes hands and salutes the numerous officials and representatives of different organizations.

81
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:26,312
Jag vill tala om en tacksamhet för er vänlighet att anmåla mig att förrätta detta i den här invigningen.

82
00:10:51,038 --> 00:11:01,261
under uttalande och ta min uppriktiga glädje över att denna utställning nu blivit denna besvarsutställning nu blivit anordnad och öppnad samt med mina bästa velönsningar för den samma.

83
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:03,682
Nu förklarar jag nu utställningen öppnad och invigd.

84
00:11:03,702 --> 00:11:04,082
Evening has come

85
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:22,322
När kingens returnen drottningholm.

86
00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:24,825
Aftonrad är det mänting dig.

87
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:27,446
Varje dag ens.

88
00:11:28,126 --> 00:11:31,048
Det får på en lajt så fara det var spred vånt en tjej.

89
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:33,809
Men det kan ju inte sveit kan man inte det blir ju brun.

90
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,272
Vad är det här kom på tjejer som fanns i öppen färgplats.

91
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:05,676
Och nu har kungen en stund att prata med de kvinnorna på kvällen, titta på kvällens avsnitt, smaka en cigarett,

92
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:07,376
En vänkisk koffej.

93
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:11,620
Men hans jobb är inte slut ännu.

94
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,403
Många dokument måste sänkas för att bli valida.

95
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:21,048
Enligt en gammal custom är krigets signaturer alltid gröna med sand.

96
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:27,553
Några av beslutna är resultatet av morgons säsong av crown council.

97
00:13:27,594 --> 00:13:32,738
Och när kriget har skrivit sin namn till dem börjar han dem på deras väg.

98
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:39,738
All these documents together represent everyday life in Sweden.

99
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:42,659
They are the nations pulse.

100
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:53,187
And with the completion of this last duty, the father of the people brings his day to a close.

101
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:06,802
I.
