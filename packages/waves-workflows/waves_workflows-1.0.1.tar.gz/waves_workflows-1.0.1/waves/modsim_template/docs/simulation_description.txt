   Simulation schematic

The rectangle model is comprised of a single 2D square part with nominal dimensions 1mm x 1mm, but which can be
parameterized by width and height by the journal file: :mod:`modsim_package.abaqus.rectangle_geometry`.

The bottom left node of the geometry is restricted in all six translational/rotational degrees of freedom using an
encastre boundary condition. The bottom edge uses a roller boundary condition, with no translation in the 2 direction,
but is free to move in the 1 direction.

Loading is prescribed as a uniaxial displacement of the top edge of the part in the negative 2 direction (compression),
with a nominal displacement of -0.01 mm, which can be parameterized in the workflow.
