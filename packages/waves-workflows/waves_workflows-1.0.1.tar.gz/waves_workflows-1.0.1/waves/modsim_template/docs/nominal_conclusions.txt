The stress-strain plot shows that the simulation model is acting as expected with a linear elastic response through a
10% compressive strain load. This verifies that the geometry journal file and linear elastic material model are
implemented correctly and provides confidence in the journal file and simulation input files for future simulations and
analysis.
