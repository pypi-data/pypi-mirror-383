The rectangle model is simple demonstration for how to exercise the capabilities of a `WAVES`_ workflow
:cite:`waves-software`. It is a single 2D square, plane-stress element oriented in the 1-2 plane consisting of a mock,
linear-elastic material model, simple boundary conditions, and applied uniaxial compression. The simulation preparation
and solve are conducted in Abaqus :cite:`ABAQUS`.
