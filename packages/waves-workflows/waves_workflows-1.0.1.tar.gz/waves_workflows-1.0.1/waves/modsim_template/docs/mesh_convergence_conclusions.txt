As expected from the simple loading and boundary conditions, the mesh convergence study shows that the quantity of
interest (QoI), stress in the loading direction, converges with a rectangle. This verifies that the parameterized
implementation of the load and boundary conditions correctly handles the mesh density and provides confidence in the
simulation journal files for applications to future parameter studies of material properties and load.
