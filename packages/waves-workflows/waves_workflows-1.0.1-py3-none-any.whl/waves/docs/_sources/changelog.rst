*******************

.. warning::

   The ``quantiles`` removal from parameter generator objects will cause parameter set index changes for stochastically
   sampled parameter generators, e.g. ``SALib`` and ``SciPy`` based generators. Parameter studies generated with this
   version may not merge correctly with parameter studies from older versions of WAVES even if the parameter sets have
   not changed. It is strongly recommended that users re-generate their parameter study files.

Breaking changes
================

  data arrays and greater type flexibility when writing parameter studies to H5 files (:issue:`794`, :merge:`975`). By

  parameter data arrays and greater type flexibility when writing parameter studies to H5 files (:issue:`765`,

  using the function as an SCons method. See the API and examples (:issue:`764`, :merge:`992`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Deprecate the ``copy_substitute`` function in favor or ``copy_substfile`` (:issue:`665`, :merge:`990`). `Kyle

- Updated release instructions to use git tag (:issue:`532`, :merge:`667`). By `Sergio Cordova`_.

  (:issue:`542`, :merge:`661`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Fixed failing tests (:issue:`544`, :merge:`663`, :issue:`545`, :merge:`664`). By `Sergio Cordova`_.

******************
0.7.2 (2023-10-10)
******************

New Features
============
- Added draft Sphinx dependency scanner (:merge:`640`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Add an SCons environment constructor from shell commands (:issue:`531`, :merge:`646`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Add wrapper function and decorator to catenate builder actions and wrap with an outer program (:merge:`647`,
  :merge:`648`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Abaqus solver, Abaqus journal, and Sierra SLURM Sbatch builders (:merge:`647`, :merge:`648`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Draft SSH builder wrapper (:merge:`649`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Python SLURM Sbatch builder (:issue:`539`, :merge:`657`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Accept Sbatch command-line options in the Sbatch wrapper builders (:issue:`539`, :merge:`657`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.

Documentation
=============

- Add a version check warning and instructions to the quickstart and core tutorials (:issue:`540`, :merge:`656`). By
  `Kyle Brindley`_.

Internal Changes
================
- Trial update to run the system test suite in parallel. It's possible the system tests are not yet thread safe (using a
  common ``.sconsign.dblite`` file but separate build directories), but this wasn't observed in local testing. It's also
  possible that Abaqus token availability will periodically timeout job submissions. If this produces many false negative
  tests requiring manual intervention, revert commit ``d2e3c9d1``  (:issue:`519`, :merge:`641`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Elevate PDF documentation build warnings to errors to match other sphinx build behaviors (:merge:`642`). By `Kyle
  Brindley`_.
- Reduce operations required to set the builder post actions (:issue:`535`, :merge:`650`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- More complete tests for the ssh builder action wrapper function (:issue:`533`, :merge:`651`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.

  Brindley`_.
- Update package build requirements to reflect current working package combinations. Eventually we will need to solve
  the ``setuptools_scm>=8`` error messages (:issue:`538`, :merge:`655`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.

Enhancements
============
- In the SLURM ``sbatch`` builder, use the ``sbatch`` native output redirection to capture the executing job's output
  instead of the minimal ``sbatch`` output (:issue:`528`, :merge:`644`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Use the draft Sphinx dependency scanner in the quickstart template modsim project (:issue:`529`, :merge:`645`). By
  `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Update the Sierra execution environment solution (:issue:`531`, :merge:`646`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.

  (:issue:`495`, :merge:`613`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Rename the ``waves.builders`` module as ``waves.scons_extensions`` to reflect the growing scope of SCons extensions
  beyond a collection of builders. Backward compatilibity is maintained by duplicating the module under the old name

  non-default, temporary build directories (:issue:`518`, :merge:`635`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Drive the system tests (tutorials) from pytest during conda builds (:merge:`629`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.

- Unit test the WAVES copy and substitute builder function (:issue:`52`, :merge:`40`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Unit test the WAVES Abaqus Journal builder and emitter (:issue:`50`, :merge:`41`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Unit test the WAVES Abaqus Solver builder and emitter (:issue:`51`, :merge:`51`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Search a user provided construction environment for the 'abaqus_wrapper' program before using the WAVES internal
  project bin. Allows users to override the WAVES Abaqus wrapper with their own (:issue:`40`, :merge:`47`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Separate the development environment fast tests from the Conda build/test job. Skip the WAVES documentation build in the
  Conda packaging process (:issue:`67`, :merge:`48`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Deploy as a ``noarch`` Conda package (:issue:`69`, :merge:`51`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.

Enhancements
============
- Avoid build file creation in the source directory during copy/substitution operations, e.g. SolverPrep (:issue:`16`,
  :merge:`25`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Provide an optional Abaqus program argument to the Abaqus builders (:issue:`40`, :merge:`47`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.

******************
0.1.4 (2022-05-06)
******************

New Features
============
- Add parameter study module and tests (:issue:`27`, :merge:`19`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Add Conda build recipe (:issue:`35`, :merge:`21`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Deploy Conda package as "waves" to AEA Conda channel (:issue:`36`, :merge:`22`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.

Documentation
=============
- Use WAVES repository version in WAVES-EABM documentation (:issue:`31`, :merge:`18`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.

******************
0.1.3 (2022-05-05)
******************

New Features
============
- Append the Abaqus journal Builder managed targets automatically (:issue:`18`, :merge:`10`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Separate the common custom builders from the EABM SCons project configuration (:issue:`19`, :merge:`11`). By `Kyle
  Brindley`_.
- Add a variable to pass through additional Abaqus command-line arguments to the Abaqus journal file builder
  (:issue:`19`, :merge:`11`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Add the SCons target definition equivalent to the ECMF and CMake-simulation Abaqus simulation execution (:issue:`21`,
  :merge:`13`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.

Bug fixes
=========
- Avoid modifying the contents or timestamp of input files in Abaqus journal files (:issue:`17`, :merge:`12`). By `Kyle
  Brindley`_.

Documentation
=============
- Add SCons custom builder documentation for the build system (:issue:`19`, :merge:`11`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Separate the Scons build system documentation from the associated WAVES-EABM documentation (:issue:`26`, :merge:`16`).
  By `Kyle Brindley`_.

Internal Changes
================
- Remove the dummy ``{job_name}.touch`` file from the Abaqus wrapper. SCons does not automatically delete target file(s)
  when the build fails like GNU Make or CMake does (:issue:`24`, :merge:`14`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.

******************
0.1.2 (2022-05-04)

  :merge:`3`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Add the SCons target definition equivalent to the ECMF and CMake-simulation "Tutorial 02: partition and mesh"
  (:issue:`11`, :merge:`4`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Add the SCons target definition equivalent to the ECMF and CMake-simulation "Tutorial 03: solverprep" (:issue:`14`,
  :merge:`6`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Link the SCons man pages to the expected man page directory of the Conda environment (:issue:`15`, :merge:`7`). By
  `Kyle Brindley`_.

Bug fixes
=========
- Fix the documentation alias declaration (:issue:`6`, :merge:`8`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.

Documentation
=============
