"""Module of package specific exceptions.

The project design intent is to print error messages to STDERR and return non-zero exit codes when used as a command
line utility (CLI), but raise exceptions when used as a package (API). The only time a stack trace should be printed
when using the CLI is if the exception is unexpected and may represent an internal bug.

Most raised exceptions in the package API should be Python built-ins. However, to support the CLI error handling
described above some exceptions need to be uniquely identifiable as package exceptions and not third-party exceptions.
:meth:`waves.exceptions.WAVESError` and ``RuntimeError`` exceptions will be be caught by the command line utility and
converted to error messages and non-zero return codes. Third-party exceptions represent truly unexpected behavior that
may be an internal bug and print a stack trace.

This behavior could be supported by limiting package raised exceptions to RuntimeError exceptions; however, more
specific exceptions are desirable when using the package API to allow end-users to handle different collections of API
exceptions differently.
