# StrainRelief 💊
StrainRelief calculates the ligand strain of uncharged docked poses and has a suite of different force fields with which to do this. This includes our own MACE neural network potential trained on SPICE2 but also includes Meta's FairChem models such as e-SEN and UMA.

## Update: v0.5
1. Switched to uv for package management.
2. Introduced custom typing (`MolsDict`, `MolPropertiesDict`, `EnergiesDict` and `ConfEnergiesDict`) to make functions more readable.
3. Updated workflows and `MolsDict` to include charge and spin. This allows for charge aware NNPs such as eSEN and UMA. A boolean kwarg (`include_charged=True`) has been added to `load_parquets` to optionally filter these out.
4. Restructured calling of the main function to make it more intuitive with PyPi packaging.

## Installation

### Installation from PyPi

```
pip install strain-relief
```

### Installation from source

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) if not already installed. Create a new `uv` enviroment using:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

From the root directory, run the following commands to install the package and its dependencies in editable mode:

(`mace-torch==0.3.x` requires `e3nn==0.4.4` (only for training, not inference). `fairchem-core` requires `e3nn>=0.5`. So until `mace-torch==0.4` is released we will have to do this finicky way of installing ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace/issues/555)).)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prescient-design/StrainRelief.git

uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
uv pip install --force-reinstall e3nn==0.5 fairchem-core
uv run pre-commit install
```

or if you have a `uv.lock` file:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --editable
```

## The Protocol

The protocol used in StrainRelief is designed to be simple, fast and model agnostic - all that is needed to apply a new force field is to write an ASE calculator wrapper. Additionally you can use any MACE model, such as these from the [MACE-OFF23](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-off/tree/main/mace_off23) repository.

![Strain Relief Protocol](assets/strain_relief_protocol.png)

The protocol consists of 5 steps:

1. Minimise the docked pose with a loose convergence criteria to give a local minimum.
2. Generate 20 conformers from the docked ligand pose.
3. Minimise the generated conformers (and the original docked pose) with a stricter convergence criteria.
4. Evaluate the energy of all conformers and choose the lowest energy as an approximation of the global minimum.
5. Calculate `E(ligand strain) = E(local minimum) - E(global minimum)` and apply threshold.

**N.B.** energies returned are in kcal/mol.

## Usage

StrainRelief runs are configured using hydra configs.

### Python Package

```
from strain_relief import compute_strain

strains = compute_strain(poses: list[RDKit.Mol], config: DictConfig)

for i, r in computed.iterrows():
    print(f"Pose {r['id']} has a strain of {r['ligand_strain']:.2f} kcal/mol")
```
For a complete example see the tutorial [notebook](./examples/tutorial.ipynb).

### Command Line

```bash
strain-relief \
    experiment=mmff94s \
    io.input.parquet_path=data/example_ligboundconf_input.parquet \
    io.output.parquet_path=data/example_ligboundconf_output.parquet \
```

More examples are given [here](./examples/examples.sh), including the command used for the calculations in the StrainRelief paper.

### Configurations

**RDKit kwargs**

The following dictionaries are passed directly to the function of that name.
- `conformers` (`EmbedMultipleConfs`)
- `minimisation.MMFFGetMoleculeProperties`
- `minimisation.MMFFGetMoleculeForceField`
- `energy_eval.MMFFGetMoleculeProperties`
- `energy_eval.MMFFGetMoleculeForceField`

The hydra config is set up to allow additional kwargs to be passed to these functions e.g. `+minimisation.MMFFGetMoleculeProperties.mmffVerbosity=1`.

**Common kwargs**
- `threshold` (set by default to 16.1 kcal/mol - calibrated using [LigBoundConf 2.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/erwallace/LigBoundConf2.0))
- `conformers.numConfs`
- `global_min.maxIters`/`local_min.maxIters`
- `global_min.fmax`/`local_min.maxIters`
- `io.input.include_charged`
- `hydra.verbose`
- `seed`

### Logging

Logging is set to the `INFO` level by default which logs only aggregate information. `hydra.verbose=true` can be used to activate `DEBUG` level logging which includes information for every molecule and conformer.

## Unit Tests
- `uv run pytest tests/` - runs all tests (unit and integration)
- `uv run pytest tests/ -m "not gpu"` - excludes all MACE tests
- `uv run pytest tests/ -m "not integration"` - runs all unit tests

**NB** Tests requiring a FAIRChem model will be skipped if the OMol25 eSEN small conserving model is not located in `tests/models/eSEN.pt`. This model can be downloaded [here](https://huggingface.co/facebook/OMol25).
