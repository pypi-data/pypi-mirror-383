    \ values are dates. Dates in alpha columns might not sort correctly, and might\
    \ contradict user expectations downstream. It's also possible that more than one\
    \ type of information is stored in the column, making it harder to retrieve. \

    Review your source data and ingestion process. Consider whether it might be better to store the date values as a date or datetime column. If the alpha data is also significant, you could store it in a different column.
