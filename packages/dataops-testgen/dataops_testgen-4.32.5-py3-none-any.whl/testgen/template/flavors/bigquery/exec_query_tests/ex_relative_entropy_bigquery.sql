-- Relative Entropy:  measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence
--   Smoothed and normalized version of KL divergence,
--   with scores between 0 (identical) and 1 (maximally different),
--   when using the base-2 logarithm.   Formula is:
--   0.5 * kl_divergence(p, m) + 0.5 * kl_divergence(q, m)
--   Log base 2 of x = LN(x)/LN(2)
