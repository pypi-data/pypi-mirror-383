# FPowerKit - A power distribution network calculation component

This is a package designed for power distribution network description and solving. Solvers include Newton method, DistFlow and OpenDSS.

This package is affiliated to V2Sim, an open-aource microscopic V2G simulation platform in urban power and transportation network. If you are using the modified DistFlow model in this package, please cite the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970754)ï¼š

### Installation options
If you want to use different features, install with different command:

|Feature|Command|
|---|---|
|Only grid description|`pip install fpowerkit`|
|Y matrix & Newton|`pip install fpowerkit[newton]`|
|OpenDSS|`pip install fpowerkit[dss]`|
|DistFlow|`pip install fpowerkit[distflow]`|
|All|`pip install fpowerkit[full]`|

Secondary development on this package requires all features.

### Introduction
There are 3 modes for this package to work:

- Optimal power flow (OPF): Use cvxpy to solve the optimal power flow and determine the output of the generators.

- Power flow calculation: Use OpenDSS/Newton-Raphson method to solve the power flow.

- Hybrid: Use OPF to determine the initial value, and then use OpenDSS/Newton-Raphson to perform accurate calculation.
