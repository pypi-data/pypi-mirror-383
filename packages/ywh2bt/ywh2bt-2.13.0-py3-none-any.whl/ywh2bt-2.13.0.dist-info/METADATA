# ywh2bt

ywh2bt synchronizes your vulnerability reports from the [Yes We Hack platform][YesWeHack-Platform]
with issues of your bug tracker(s). It automatically retrieves reports you want to copy in your bug tracker,
creates the related issue, and syncs further updates between issues and reports.  
It comes with a handy GUI to set up and test the integration,
while completely controlling the information you allow to be synchronized from both side.

## User Guide

A User Guide is available in [PDF][User-Guide-pdf] and [HTML][User-Guide-html] formats.

## Architecture

YWH2BT embeds both the GUI to set up the integration,
and the application to be scheduled on your server to periodically poll and synchronize new reports.  
You can either run both on a single machine, or prepare the configuration file
on a computer (with the GUI) and transfer it on the server and use it through a scheduled command.

Since data is pulled from YWH platform to your server, only regular outbound web connections need to be authorized on your server.

## Requirements

- `python` >=3.7,<=3.12
- [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

## Local development

### Requirements

- [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) (`pip install poetry`)

### Installation

- `make install` (or `poetry install`): creates a virtualenv and install dependencies
- `make install-with-gui` (or `poetry install --extras=gui`): creates a virtualenv and install dependencies, including the gui

### Usage

Instead of `ywh2bt [command]`, run commands using `poetry run ywh2bt [command]`.

Same goes for `ywh2bt-gui`, run `poetry run ywh2bt-gui` instead.

### Updating User Guide

[PDF][User-Guide-pdf] and [HTML][User-Guide-html] versions of the User Guide are generated via Pandoc
using [docs/User-Guide.md][User-Guide-md] as an input file.  
Any changes made to [docs/User-Guide.md][User-Guide-md] **must be followed** by the execution of the command
`make user-guide` in order to regenerate the PDF and HTML files, **otherwise the CI will fail**.
