  This simple two-variable model was created by modifying the model by FitzHugh
  & Nagumo to describe cardiac excitation waves. It models restitution of
  action potential duration, i.e., its dependence on cycle length. It was
  originally designed for canine ventricles, but is considered a
  phenomenological model.
