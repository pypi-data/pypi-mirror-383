  A model for electrical activity of cardiac membrane which incorporates only
  an inward and an outward current. This model is useful for three reasons: (1)
  Its simplicity, comparable to the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, makes it useful in
  numerical simulations, especially in two or three spatial dimensions where
  numerical efficiency is so important. (2) It can be understood analytically
  without recourse to numerical simulations. This allows us to determine rather
  completely how the parameters in the model affect its behavior which in turn
  provides insight into the effects of the many parameters in more realistic
  models. (3) It naturally gives rise to a one-dimensional map which specifies
  the action potential duration as a function of the previous diastolic interval.
  For certain parameter values, this map exhibits a new phenomenon--subcritical
  alternans--that does not occur for the commonly used exponential map.
