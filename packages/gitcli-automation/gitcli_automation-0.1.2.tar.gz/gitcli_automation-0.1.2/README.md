gitcli sync
```

### Branch Workflow
```bash
# Create new feature branch
gitcli add-branch

# Work on changes...
gitcli qp

# Switch back to main
gitcli switch-branch
```

## Interactive Mode Features

When running `gitcli` without arguments:
- **Tab completion**: Press Tab to autocomplete commands
- **Branch indicator**: Shows current branch in prompt
- **Persistent session**: Run multiple commands without restarting
- **Command history**: Use arrow keys to navigate previous commands

## Safety Features

- **Confirmation prompts** for destructive operations (delete, reset, force push)
- **"yes" requirement** for dangerous operations (not just "y")
- **Branch protection**: Can't delete current branch
- **Change detection**: Warns about uncommitted changes
- **Remote checks**: Validates remote exists before push/pull operations
