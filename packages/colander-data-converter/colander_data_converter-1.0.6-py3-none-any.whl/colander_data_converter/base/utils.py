class BaseModelMerger:
    """
    A utility class for merging :py:class:`pydantic.BaseModel` instances with configurable strategies.

    This class provides functionality to merge fields from a source BaseModel into a
    destination BaseModel, handling both regular model fields and extra attributes.
    Fields containing `ObjectReference` types are automatically
    excluded from merging and reported as unprocessed.

    The merger supports two strategies:

    - ``PRESERVE``: Only merge fields if the destination field is empty or `None`
    - ``OVERWRITE``: Always merge fields from source to destination

    Fields are merged based on type compatibility and field constraints. Extra
    attributes are automatically converted to strings when stored in the attribute
    dictionary (if supported by the destination model).

    Example:
        >>> from pydantic import BaseModel
        >>> class SourceModel(BaseModel):
        ...     name: str
        ...     age: int
        ...     attributes: dict = {}
        >>> class DestinationModel(BaseModel):
        ...     name: str
        ...     age: int
        ...     city: str = "Unknown"
        ...     attributes: dict = {}
        >>> source = SourceModel(name="Alice", age=30)
        >>> destination = DestinationModel(name="Bob", age=25)
        >>> merger = BaseModelMerger(strategy=MergingStrategy.OVERWRITE)
        >>> unprocessed = merger.merge(source, destination)
        >>> print(destination.name)
        Alice
        >>> print(destination.age)
        30
        >>> print(destination.city)
        Unknown

    Note:
        - Fields with ``ObjectReference`` types are never merged and are reported as unprocessed
        - Frozen fields cannot be modified and will be reported as unprocessed
        - Complex types (list, dict, tuple, set) in extra attributes are not supported
        - Extra attributes are converted to strings when stored
