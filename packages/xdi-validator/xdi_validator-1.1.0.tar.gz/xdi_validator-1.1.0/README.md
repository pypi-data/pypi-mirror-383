# XDI-Validator

## What is it?

XDI-Validator is a standalone JSON Schema based validator for XDI files.
XDI (*.xdi) is a format used to save XAS data. This validator aim to be
fully compliant with the XDI/1.0 specification, as detailed in the documents 
[XAS Data Interchange Format Draft Specification, version 1.0](https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XAS-Data-Interchange/blob/master/specification/xdi_spec.pdf)
and [Dictionary of XAS Data Interchange Metadata](https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XAS-Data-Interchange/blob/master/specification/xdi_dictionary.pdf).

## Usage 

As simple as it gets : 

```python
# import the functionality from the module
from xdi_validator import validate, XDIEndOfHeaderMissingError

# open the xdi file
with open('filename.xdi', 'r') as xdi_document:
    
    # Validate the file. If there is no end-of-header token
    # an exception is raised
    try:
        xdi_errors, xdi_dict = validate(xdi_document)
    except XDIEndOfHeaderMissingError as ex:
        print(ex.message)
        
    # check if there are errors
    if xdi_errors:
        print('XDI is invalid!')
        print(xdi_errors)
    else:
        print('XDI is valid!')
        print(xdi_dict)
    
```
Basically, the method `xdi_validator.validate()` the `*.xdi` file-like object and will return a dictionary with the found errors per each field, 
and a representation of the contents of the `*.xdi` as a dictionary. The dictionary of errors is organized in the following way. 
The keys are the path (`Namespace.tag`) of the invalid field, and the corresponding value is the list of errors.

Note: Sure, users can also to use the library for parsing and converting XDI files into json representation.
