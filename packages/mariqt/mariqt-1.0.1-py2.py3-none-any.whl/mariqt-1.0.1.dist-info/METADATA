We strive to make marine image data FAIR. We develop FDOs for images to establish a common language for marine imagery, we develop best-practice operating procedures for handling marine images and we develop the MarIQT software to apply the iFDOs and procedures to marine imagery. MarIQT stands for Image Quality control / quality assurance and curation Tools (IQT) conceptualised and developed by the MareHub working group on Videos/Images (part of the DataHub, a research data manangement initiative by the Helmholtz association).
