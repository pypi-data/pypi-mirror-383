## üìù Notes

Financial ratios calculations are perfomed on all dates and then filtered by Bollinger bands on basis of window_size,- Allows Storing all financial ratios (if ratios_to_file parameter is set to True)

- More Analysis and calculations can be performed now that all ratios data is saved to a feather file as well
- Final outcome : feather file for ratios and / or bollinger + returning the same for models
- Further down can implement Caching mechanism to  manage all records in better manner and make them readily available for Bollinger bands or other calculations

## ‚ú® Features

- üìà Built on top of financial-engine
- üîÅ Perform bollinger bands caluclation for provided ratio columns
- üöó Accepts Single company (alpha_code) as well as Multiple Companies (list of alpha_codes)
- ‚ö° Caching : Option to save ratios and bollingers for further calculations

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
pip install financial-bollinger-bands
```

### Step-by-step

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
