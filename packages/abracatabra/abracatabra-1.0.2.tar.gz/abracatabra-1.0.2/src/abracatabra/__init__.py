abracatabra
===========
A package for creating tabbed plot windows with matplotlib in a Qt environment.

Windows can be created with one or more tab groups. Each tab group can contain
one or more tabs, where is tab is a matplotlib Figure. The library provides
functions to show all open windows, update them, and a fun `abracatabra`
function to display all windows with a magical touch.

This package provides:
- `TabbedPlotWindow`: The main class for creating and managing tabbed plot windows.
- `show_all_windows`: Displays all open tabbed plot windows.
- `update_all_windows`: Updates all open tabbed plot windows.
- `abracatabra`: A fun function to display all open tabbed plot windows.
- `is_interactive`: Checks if the current environment is interactive (e.g., IPython or Jupyter).
- `__version__`: The version of the abracatabra package.

        tight_layout (bool): If True, applies a tight layout to all figures.
        block (bool): If True, block and run the GUI until all windows are
            closed, either individually or by pressing <ctrl+c> in the terminal.

def update_all_windows(delay_seconds: float = 0.0) -> float:
    """
    Updates all open tabbed plot windows. This is similar to pyplot.pause()
    and is generally used to update the figure in a loop, e.g., an animation.
    This function only updates active tabs in each window, so inactive tabs are
    skipped to save time.

    Args:
        delay_seconds (float): The minimum delay in seconds before returning. If
            windows are updated faster than this, this function will block until
            `delay_seconds` seconds have passed. If the windows take longer than
            `delay_seconds` seconds to update, the function execution time will
            be greater than `delay_seconds`.
    Returns:
        update_time (float): The amount of time (seconds) taken to update the
            windows.
