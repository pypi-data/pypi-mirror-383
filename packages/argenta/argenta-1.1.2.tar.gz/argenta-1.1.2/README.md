### Library for creating modular CLI applications

Argenta allows you to encapsulate CLI functionality in isolated, abstracted environments. Eg: you are creating a utility similar to the Metasploit Framework, where the user first logs into a specific scope (for example, selects a module to scan), and then gets access to a set of commands specific only to that context. Argenta provides a simple and concise way to build such an architecture.
