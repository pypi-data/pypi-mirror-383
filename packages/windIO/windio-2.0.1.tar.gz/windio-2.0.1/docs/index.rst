windIO: a community-focused data I/O format for wind energy systems
===================================================================

windIO is a data format for inputs and outputs to wind energy system computational models.
Historically, it has focused on systems engineering models, but it has been adopted in other
topic areas of wind energy modeling, as well.
The windIO data format is a community-focused effort to standardize the data format for wind energy
system models, and we encourage collaboration.
The github repository is at https://github.com/IEAWindSystems/windIO and the
online documentation is at https://ieawindsystems.github.io/windIO.

This windIO repository including the following:

- Schema defining windIO components describing wind turbines and wind plants
- Python library for validating files relative to the schema and loading the data into a Python dictionary
- windIO input files for test-case wind turbine and wind plant models

Installation
------------

windIO is typically included as a dependency in software that uses the windIO data format, so
users will normally not need to install it directly.
However, it can be useful to install the windIO package to access version converters or during
integration into a software package.
In that case, windIO can be installed from PyPI with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install windIO

Supporting windIO in your software
----------------------------------

The windIO data format is defined by the schemas included in this repository.
In order for a software to support windIO, it must support the data as described in the schemas
and use the included functions to validate the data.
windIO should be included as a dependency.
It is distributed through PyPI and can be installed as a package with pip.
The suggested method of incorporating windIO into your code is:

.. code-block:: python

   import windIO

   # Other code here

   windIO.validate(input="path/to/input.yaml", schema_type="plant/wind_energy_system <for example>")
   windIO.load_yaml("path/to/input.yaml")

   # Conversion to your software's data structures here

Software library reference

.. automodule:: windIO
   :members: validate, load_yaml, write_yaml
