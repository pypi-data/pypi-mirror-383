Turbine Schema
--------------

The documentation of the turbine ontology is split into two parts. The first section is intended for newer users of windIO and provides a
high-level overview of the turbine model and walks the user on how to build the geometry yaml file.
New users are encouraged to start with this section, as it provides a good introduction to the turbine model and its components.

The second section is intended for advanced users and provides a detailed description of the turbine model and its components.
The turbine model is defined in the `turbine_schema.yaml` file, which is located in the `windIO/schemas/turbine` directory.
The schema is written in YAML format and is used to validate the turbine model.
The schema is also used to generate the documentation for the turbine model.
