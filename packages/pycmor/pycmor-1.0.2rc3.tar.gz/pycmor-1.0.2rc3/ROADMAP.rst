===================
Development Roadmap
===================

Here is how we envision the development of the next several versions:

.. versionadded:: 1.0.0

   - Initial Release of stable, tested features

.. versionadded:: 1.0.1

   - Fix bugs found between initial release and preparing the workshop.

.. versionadded:: 1.0.2

   - Fix bugs found during the workshop

.. versionadded:: 1.1.0

   - Non-semantic minor version bump: From this point forward, any patch
     number changes correspond to bug fixes that are found after the tool
     has been officially released and demonstrated to end-users.

.. versionadded:: 1.X.0

   - New features will be added upon request by the community, subject to
     the resources of the development team.

.. versionadded:: 2.0.0

   - CMIP7 Support
