# Getting Started

## Installation

Codeaudit **SHOULD** be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install codeaudit
```

or use:

```bash
pip install -U codeaudit
```

If you have installed and used Python Codeaudit in the past and want to make benefit  of new checks and features.

:::{hint} 
It is recommended to use `pip` for installation. 

`Hatch` is used for packaging. By default [`Hatch`](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/#reproducible-builds) supports [reproducible builds](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/securityarchitecture/prevention/reproduciblebuilds.html#reproducible-builds).

:::{admonition} A default workflow
:class: tip

If you want to inspect a package or directory of Python files a simple workflow is:

1. Start with an overview: `codeaudit overview`

This will give valuable security statistics.

2. Do a file or directory scan: `codeaudit filescan` 

This will give a detailed report for all file(s) with potential security issues listed by line number.

3. Inspect the used modules of a file on reported vulnerabilities by: `codeaudit modulescan`

This will give a detailed report on known vulnerabilities for a module.

Codeaudit - Modern Python source code analyzer based on distrust.

Commands to evaluate Python source code:
Usage: codeaudit COMMAND [PATH or FILE]  [OUTPUTFILE] 

Depending on the command, a directory or file name must be specified. The output is a static HTML file to be examined in a browser. Specifying a name for the output file is optional.

Commands:
  overview             Reports Complexity and statistics per Python file from a directory.
  modulescan           Reports module information per file.
  filescan             Reports potential security issues for a single Python file.
  directoryscan        Reports potential security issues for all Python files found in a directory.
  checks               Generate an HTML report of all implemented codeaudit security checks.
  version              Prints the module version. Use [-v] [--v] [-version] or [--version].
