# NuCom

**NuCom** (Numerical Computing) is a high-performance numerical computing framework for Python.  
It provides easy-to-use abstractions for array operations, linear algebra, and accelerated computation on CPUs and GPUs.

## Features

- **Numerical Computing Made Simple**: Easy-to-use array and matrix operations.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for multi-core CPUs and GPU acceleration.
- **Pythonic API**: Similar in style to NumPy, making it easy to learn and integrate.
- **Extensible**: Designed for adding custom operations and backends.

## Installation

```bash
pip install nucom
