About external files
====================

Trees whose root headline starts with @file, @auto or @edit create external
files on your file system. Here are some example headlines::

    @file myClass.py
    @auto ../graphics/circles.cpp
    @edit ~/.leo/.leoID.txt

As you can see, these nodes specify file names, which can be an absolute
path or a path relative to the directory containing the Leo outline.

Collectively, nodes that create external files are known as @<file> nodes.
Leo defines several other kinds of @<file> nodes, but this slideshow will
not discuss them.
