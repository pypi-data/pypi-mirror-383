Building scripts from outlines
==============================

Leo scripts can be composed of more than one node, just as with external files.

The Execute Script command expands expanding section references and @others directives. For example::

    """docstring"""
    @others
    controller(c).run()

A child node will contain something like the following::

    class controller:
        def __init__(self,c):
            self.c = c
        @others

The children of the top-level class node will contain all the methods of the controller class.
