c, g and p
==========

Leo scripts execute in an environment containing three predefined objects: c, g and p.

**g** is Leo’s leoGlobals module. This module contains dozens of utility functions and classes.

**c** is the commander of the outline containing the script. Commanders
define all of Leo’s commands, as well as other data.

**p** is the position of the presently selected node. Positions objects
represent positions in the traversal of Leo outlines.

This slideshow shows how to use c, g and p in Leo scripts. For full details
about scripting in Leo, see the Scripting Chapter in Leo’s Users Guide.
