Introduction to scripting
=========================

For me, scripting is the most fun part of Leo.

Leo can execute any body text as a Leo script, Python scripts that have full access to all data in any open Leo outline, as well as full access to all parts of Leo’s source code.

Leo’s Ctrl-B (execute-script) command runs the body text of a node as a Leo script.
