Example
=======

Suppose you want to print out the list of Leo’s commands.

You need only remember that commands start with “show”. Just type::

    <alt-x>pri<tab>

You will see “show-” in the minibuffer.

The Completion tab in the log pane shows all the commands that start with “show-”.
