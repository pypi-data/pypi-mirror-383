########################
Clones are the same node
########################

Changing the headline or body text of a clone changes the headline or body
text of all other clones of that node. Furthermore, changing any
descendants of a clone, including inserting, deleting or moving nodes,
results in the same changes being made to all other clones.

In fact, all clones of a node are actually the exactly the same node, so
any change to one clone inevitably affects all other clones.
