About clones
############

Clones are one of Leoâ€™s most unusual and most useful features.

A clone is a node that appears in more than one place in a Leo outline.

Here, we have cloned node A by selecting A and doing Ctrl=` (clone-node)

Clones are marked with a small red clone arrow* in the icon box. Deleting
the penultimate clone removes the red arrow from the node.
