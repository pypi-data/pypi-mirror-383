The ultimate filing cabinet
===========================

Clones are important because they allow you to create as many views of the
data in the outline as you like.

Leo acts like flexible filing cabinet.

Any ordinary node can act like a folder in the filing cabinet. Using
clones, you can “file” a node in as many folders as you like.
