Views concentrate data
======================

Task nodes focus attention on the task at hand.

There is no need to jump around the outline!

No matter how complex the task (or the outline!), all relevant data appear in one place (the task node and its descendants).

Leo will mark as dirty all @<file> nodes containing any changed clones.
As a result, Leo will update all external files automatically. Everything “just works”.
