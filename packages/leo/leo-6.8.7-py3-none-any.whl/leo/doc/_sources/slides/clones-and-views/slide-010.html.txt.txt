Views are sets of nodes
=======================

A Leo **view** is just a subset of the nodes of the outline.

We represent a view as ordinary node, called a view node (1).

The children of the view node are the subset of nodes that define the view.

An outline may contain arbitrarily many views.
You don't have to choose just one "correct" view.
