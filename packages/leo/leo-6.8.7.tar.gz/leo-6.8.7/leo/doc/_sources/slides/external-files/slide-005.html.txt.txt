Using @file trees
=================

The next few slides will show how to create external files with @file trees.

First, create an @file node giving the path to the external file. This path
can be a full, absolute path, or a relative path. Relative paths start at
Leoâ€™s load directory, the directory containing the .leo file for the
present outline. No path prefix is usually required.
