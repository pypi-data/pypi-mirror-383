The @others directive
=====================

The **@others** directive is similar to a section reference; @others tells Leo to insert text into the output file. Instead of inserting the body text of one particular node, as in a section reference, @others tells Leo to insert the body text of all nodes that are *not* section definition nodes. Thatâ€™s where the name comes from: it inserts all the *other* nodes.
