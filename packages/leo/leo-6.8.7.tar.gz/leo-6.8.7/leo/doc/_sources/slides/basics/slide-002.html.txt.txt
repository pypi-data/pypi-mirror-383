The workbook file
=================

Leo opens the **workbook file** when you start
Leo without a filename.

The body has focus--it is colored a pale pink, and
contains a blinking cursor.

**Note**: on some monitors the colors will be almost
invisible.  You can choose such colors to suit your
taste.
