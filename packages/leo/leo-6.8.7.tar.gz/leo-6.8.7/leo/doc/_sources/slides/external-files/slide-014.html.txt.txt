Orphan nodes
============

**Orphan nodes** are descendants of @<file> nodes that would not be included the external file.

Leo checks for orphan nodes when writing any @<file> tree:

- There must be a section reference for section definition node.
- There must be an @others directive for nodes that aren't section
  definitions nodes.

Leo will issue an error if an @<file> tree contains orphan nodes.
