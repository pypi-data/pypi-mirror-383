title: Column aggregate cells

```{python}
from reactable import embed_css, Reactable, Column, ColFormat, ColFormatGroupBy
from reactable.data import us_states

embed_css()
```

Column formatters can be applied to aggregated cells, produced by [grouping data](./structure-grouping.qmd).


By default, formatters apply to both standard cells and aggregate cells.

```{python}
data = us_states

col_format = ColFormat(suffix=" mi²", separators=True)

Reactable(
    data,
    group_by="Region",
    columns=[
        Column(id="Area", aggregate="sum", format=col_format),
    ],
)
```

Note that the data is collapsed, with aggregate cells displaying the total area per group. The formatter has applied the suffix ` mi²` to the aggregates.


## Formatting aggregated cells

If you want to format aggregated cells separately, provide a named list of `cell` and `aggregated` options:

```python
from reactable.models import ColFormatGroupBy

Column(
  format = ColFormatGroupBy(
    cell = colFormat(...),       # Standard cells
    aggregated = colFormat(...)  # Aggregated cells
  )
)
```

For example, only the aggregated `States` are formatted here:

```{python}
data = us_states

Reactable(
    data,
    group_by="Region",
    columns=[
        Column(
            id="States",
            aggregate="count",
            format=ColFormatGroupBy(aggregated=ColFormat(suffix=" states")),
        ),
        Column(id="Area", aggregate="sum", format=ColFormat(suffix=" mi²", separators=True)),
    ],
)
```
