With Brython you can write browser programs in Python instead of Javascript,
by inserting Python code in an HTML page by:

    <script type="text/python">
    ...
    </script>

Usage:

    pip install brython

Then in an empty folder:

    brython-cli --install

or in a folder with older versions already present:

    brython-cli --update

The package includes a page **demo.html** with examples of use. For more
information see the [Brython site](http://brython.info).
