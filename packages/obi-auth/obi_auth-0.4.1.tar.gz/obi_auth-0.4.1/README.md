# obi-auth

obi-auth is a library for retrieving Keycloak access tokens interactively. It helps developers and testers quickly authenticate against Keycloak without writing scripts or configuring complex clients.

> [!CAUTION]
> obi-auth is designed to be used interactively and should not be used within a service or application.

## Installation

### Basic Installation

```sh
pip install obi-auth
```

### Notebook Support

For enhanced Jupyter notebook support with Rich display integration:

```sh
pip install obi-auth[notebook]
```

This installs `rich` which provides better rendering in Jupyter notebooks.

## Examples

```python
from obi_auth import get_token

access_token = get_token(environment="staging")
```
