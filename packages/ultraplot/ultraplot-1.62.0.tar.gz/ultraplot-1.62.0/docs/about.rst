About UltraPlot
=================

History
-------

UltraPlot began in 2025 as a fork of `ProPlot <https://github.com/proplot-dev/proplot>`__,
an excellent plotting package created by Luke Davis. Building upon ProPlot's solid foundation,
UltraPlot was developed to extend its capabilities with new features focused on advanced
statistical visualization, enhanced interactive elements, and improved integration with
modern data science workflows.

ProPlot Legacy
-------------

UltraPlot stands on the shoulders of ProPlot, which was developed by Luke Davis starting in 2021.
As a PhD candidate at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science, Luke
created ProPlot to address the challenges of repetitive and cumbersome plotting code in
scientific research. ProPlot itself evolved from Luke's earlier MATLAB plotting utilities.

Riley Brady, an early ProPlot user, made significant contributions to the original project,
helping with automatic testing, PyPi deployment, and improving the new user experience.

The UltraPlot team is grateful to all ProPlot contributors who laid the groundwork for
this next generation of scientific visualization tools.
