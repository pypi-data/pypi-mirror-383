           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## About

Mamba is a new state space model architecture showing promising performance on information-dense data such as language modeling, where previous subquadratic models fall short of Transformers.
It is based on the line of progress on [structured state space models](https://github.com/state-spaces/s4),
with an efficient hardware-aware design and implementation in the spirit of [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention).

## Installation

- [Option] `pip install causal-conv1d>=1.4.0`: an efficient implementation of a simple causal Conv1d layer used inside the Mamba block.
- `pip install mamba-ssm`: the core Mamba package.
- `pip install mamba-ssm[causal-conv1d]`: To install core Mamba package and causal-conv1d.
- `pip install mamba-ssm[dev]`: To install core Mamba package and dev depdencies.

It can also be built from source with `pip install .` from this repository.

Try passing `--no-build-isolation` to `pip` if installation encounters difficulties either when building from source or installing from PyPi. Common `pip` complaints that can be resolved in this way include PyTorch versions, but other cases exist as well.

Other requirements:
- Linux
- NVIDIA GPU
- PyTorch 1.12+
- CUDA 11.6+

For AMD cards, see additional prerequisites below.

## Usage

We expose several levels of interface with the Mamba model.

### Selective SSM

Mamba is based on a selective SSM layer, which is the focus of the paper (Section 3; Algorithm 2).

Source: [ops/selective_scan_interface.py](mamba_ssm/ops/selective_scan_interface.py).

### Mamba Block

The main module of this repository is the Mamba architecture block wrapping the selective SSM.

Source: [modules/mamba_simple.py](mamba_ssm/modules/mamba_simple.py).

Usage:
``` python
import torch
from mamba_ssm import Mamba

batch, length, dim = 2, 64, 16
x = torch.randn(batch, length, dim).to("cuda")
model = Mamba(
    # This module uses roughly 3 * expand * d_model^2 parameters
    d_model=dim, # Model dimension d_model
    d_state=16,  # SSM state expansion factor
    d_conv=4,    # Local convolution width
    expand=2,    # Block expansion factor
).to("cuda")
y = model(x)
assert y.shape == x.shape
```

### Mamba-2

The Mamba-2 block is implemented at [modules/mamba2.py](mamba_ssm/modules/mamba2.py).

A simpler version is at [modules/mamba2_simple.py](mamba_ssm/modules/mamba2_simple.py)

The usage is similar to Mamba(-1):
``` python
from mamba_ssm import Mamba2
model = Mamba2(
    # This module uses roughly 3 * expand * d_model^2 parameters
    d_model=dim, # Model dimension d_model
    d_state=64,  # SSM state expansion factor, typically 64 or 128
    d_conv=4,    # Local convolution width
    expand=2,    # Block expansion factor
).to("cuda")
y = model(x)
assert y.shape == x.shape
```

#### SSD

A minimal version of the inner SSD module (Listing 1 from the Mamba-2 paper) with conversion between "discrete" and "continuous" SSM versions
is at [modules/ssd_minimal.py](mamba_ssm/modules/ssd_minimal.py).

### Mamba Language Model

Finally, we provide an example of a complete language model: a deep sequence model backbone (with repeating Mamba blocks) + language model head.

Source: [models/mixer_seq_simple.py](mamba_ssm/models/mixer_seq_simple.py).

This is an example of how to integrate Mamba into an end-to-end neural network.
This example is used in the generation scripts below.


## Pretrained Models

Pretrained models are uploaded to
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/state-spaces): `mamba-130m`, `mamba-370m`,
`mamba-790m`, `mamba-1.4b`, `mamba-2.8b`, `mamba2-130m`, `mamba2-370m`,
`mamba2-780m`, `mamba2-1.3b`, `mamba2-2.7b`, `transformerpp-2.7b`, `mamba2attn-2.7b`, trained on 300B tokens on the Pile, as well as `mamba-2.8b-slimpj`
(trained on 600B tokens on the SlimPajama dataset).


The models will be autodownloaded by the generation script below.

These models were trained on the [Pile](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/pile), and follow the standard model dimensions described by GPT-3 and followed by many open source models:

| Parameters | Layers | Model dim. | 
|------------|--------|------------|
| 130M       | 24     | 768        |
| 370M       | 48     | 1024       |
| 790M       | 48     | 1536       |
| 1.4B       | 48     | 2048       |
| 2.8B       | 64     | 2560       |

(The layer count of Mamba doubles that of a Transformer with similar size, as two Mamba blocks are needed for each "layer" (MHA block + MLP block) of a Transformer.)

Note: these are base models trained only for 300B tokens, without any form of downstream modification (instruction tuning, etc.).
Performance is expected to be comparable or better than other architectures trained on similar data, but not to match larger or fine-tuned models.


## Evaluations

To run zero-shot evaluations of models (corresponding to Table 3 of the paper),
we use the
[lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness)
library.

1. Install `lm-evaluation-harness` by `pip install lm-eval==0.4.2`.
2. Run evaluation with (more documentation at the [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/big-refactor) repo):
``` sh
lm_eval --model mamba_ssm --model_args pretrained=state-spaces/mamba-130m --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag,piqa,arc_easy,arc_challenge,winogrande,openbookqa --device cuda --batch_size 256
python evals/lm_harness_eval.py --model hf --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/pythia-160m --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag,piqa,arc_easy,arc_challenge,winogrande --device cuda --batch_size 64
```

To reproduce the results on the `mamba-2.8b-slimpj` model reported in the blogposts:
``` sh
lm_eval --model mamba_ssm --model_args pretrained=state-spaces/mamba-2.8b-slimpj --tasks boolq,piqa,hellaswag,winogrande,arc_easy,arc_challenge,openbookqa,race,truthfulqa_mc2 --device cuda --batch_size 256
lm_eval --model mamba_ssm --model_args pretrained=state-spaces/mamba-2.8b-slimpj --tasks mmlu --num_fewshot 5 --device cuda --batch_size 256
```

To run evaluations on Mamba-2 models, simply replace the model names:
``` sh
lm_eval --model mamba_ssm --model_args pretrained=state-spaces/mamba2-2.7b --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag,piqa,arc_easy,arc_challenge,winogrande,openbookqa --device cuda --batch_size 256
lm_eval --model mamba_ssm --model_args pretrained=state-spaces/transformerpp-2.7b --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag,piqa,arc_easy,arc_challenge,winogrande,openbookqa --device cuda --batch_size 256
lm_eval --model mamba_ssm --model_args pretrained=state-spaces/mamba2attn-2.7b --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag,piqa,arc_easy,arc_challenge,winogrande,openbookqa --device cuda --batch_size 256
```

Note that the result of each task might differ from reported values by 0.1-0.3 due to noise in the evaluation process.

## Inference

The script [benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py](benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py)
1. autoloads a model from the Hugging Face Hub,
2. generates completions of a user-specified prompt,
3. benchmarks the inference speed of this generation.

Other configurable options include the top-p (nucleus sampling) probability, and the softmax temperature.

### Examples

To test generation latency (e.g. batch size = 1) with different sampling strategies:

``` sh
python benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py --model-name "state-spaces/mamba-2.8b" --prompt "My cat wrote all this CUDA code for a new language model and" --topp 0.9 --temperature 0.7 --repetition-penalty 1.2
python benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py --model-name "EleutherAI/pythia-2.8b" --prompt "My cat wrote all this CUDA code for a new language model and" --topp 0.9 --temperature 0.7 --repetition-penalty 1.2
python benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py --model-name "state-spaces/mamba-2.8b" --prompt "My cat wrote all this CUDA code for a new language model and" --minp 0.05 --topk 0 --temperature 0.7 --repetition-penalty 1.2
```

To test generation throughput with random prompts (e.g. large batch size):
``` sh
python benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py --model-name "state-spaces/mamba-2.8b" --batch 64
python benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py --model-name "EleutherAI/pythia-2.8b" --batch 64
```

With Mamba-2, you just need to change the model name:
``` sh
python benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py --model-name "state-spaces/mamba2-2.7b" --prompt "My cat wrote all this CUDA code for a new language model and" --topp 0.9 --temperature 0.7 --repetition-penalty 1.2
```


## Troubleshooting

### Precision
Our models were trained using PyTorch [AMP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html) for mixed precision. AMP keeps model parameters in float32 and casts to half precision when necessary.
On the other hand, other frameworks like DeepSpeed store parameters in float16 and upcasts when necessary (e.g. for optimizer accumulation).

We've observed that higher precision for the main model parameters may be necessary, because SSMs are sensitive to their recurrent dynamics. If you are experiencing instabilities,
as a first step please try a framework storing parameters in fp32 (such as AMP).

### Initialization
Some parts of the model have initializations inherited from prior work on S4 models.
For [example](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/blob/f0affcf69f06d1d06cef018ff640bf080a11c421/mamba_ssm/modules/mamba_simple.py#L102), the $\Delta$ parameter has a targeted range by initializing the bias of its linear projection.
However, some frameworks may have post-initialization hooks (e.g. setting all bias terms in `nn.Linear` modules to zero).
If this is the case, you may have to add custom logic (e.g. this [line](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/blob/f0affcf69f06d1d06cef018ff640bf080a11c421/mamba_ssm/modules/mamba_simple.py#L104) turns off re-initializing in our trainer, but would be a no-op in any other framework)
that is specific to the training framework.

## Additional Prerequisites for AMD cards

### Patching ROCm

If you are on ROCm 6.0, run the following steps to avoid errors during compilation. This is not required for ROCm 6.1 onwards.

1. Locate your ROCm installation directory. This is typically found at `/opt/rocm/`, but may vary depending on your installation.

2. Apply the Patch. Run with `sudo` in case you encounter permission issues.
   ```bash
    patch /opt/rocm/include/hip/amd_detail/amd_hip_bf16.h < rocm_patch/rocm6_0.patch 
   ```
