        # Initialize the Client

        As a first step, you need to initialize the client to interact with the Aignostics Platform. This will execute an OAuth flow depending on the environment you run:
        - In case you have a browser available, an interactive login flow in your browser is started.
        - In case there is no browser available, a device flow is started.

        **NOTE:** By default, the client caches the access token in your operation systems application cache folder. If you do not want to store the access token, please initialize the client like this:

        ```python
        import aignostics.client as platform
        # initialize the client
        client = platform.Client(cache_token=False)
        ```

        # Trigger an application run

        Now, let's trigger an application run for the `Test Application`. We will use the `application_version_id` that we retrieved in the previous step. To create an application run, we need to provide a payload that consists of 1 or more items. We provide the Pydantic model `InputItem` an item and the data that comes with it:
        ```python
        platform.InputItem(
            reference="<a unique reference associate outputs to this input item>",
            input_artifacts=[platform.InputArtifact]
        )
        ```
        The `InputArtifact` defines the actual data that you provide aka. in this case the image that you want to be processed. The expected values are defined by the application version and have to align with the `input_artifacts` schema of the application version. In the case of the two task dummy application, we only require a single artifact per item, which is the image to process on. The artifact name is defined as `user_slide` for the `two-task-dummy` application and `whole_slide_image` for the `he-tme` application. The `download_url` is a signed URL that allows the Aignostics Platform to download the image data later during processing. In addition to the image data itself, you have to provide the metadata defined in the input artifact schema, i.e., `checksum_crc32c`, `base_mpp`, `width`, and `height`. The metadata is used to validate the input data and is required for the processing of the image. The following example shows how to create an item with a single input artifact:

        ```python
        platform.InputArtifact(
            name="user_slide", # as defined by the application version input_artifact schema
            download_url="<a signed url to download the data>",
            metadata={
                "checksum_crc32c": "<checksum>",
                "base_mpp": "<base_mpp>",
                "width": "<width>",
                "height": "<height>"
            }
        )
        ```
