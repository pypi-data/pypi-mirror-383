# Market Page

The Market is where you can find and install pre-built plugins. Plugins are the "tools" that give your assistants new capabilities, such as searching the web, connecting to a database, or interacting with a specific API.

Using the market is the fastest way to enhance your agent without writing any code.

## Finding and Installing Plugins

The market displays a list of all available community and official plugins. Each plugin card shows:

* **Name**: The name of the plugin.
* **Description**: A brief explanation of what the plugin does.
* **Version**: The current version of the plugin.

To install a plugin, simply click the **Download** button. Dingent will fetch the plugin's code and install any necessary dependencies in the background. Once installed, it will become available to add to any of your assistants.

## After Installation

Once a plugin is downloaded, its code is stored in the `/plugins` directory of your project. You can now head over to the Assistants page to assign this new tool to an agent.
