"""
Module with utility methods to create runtime file paths for the DALiuGE Engine.

The Engine supports implicit filepath naming if FileDROPs have no user-defined name in
the Logical Graph Template. This helps when multiple FileDROPs are created in a
construct (e.g. Scatter or Loop) and we don't run the risk of overwriting them.

This module provides the methods that support different filepath naming heuristics to
facilitate implicit filepath naming at runtime.

    This a basic filename generator, using the UID and humandReadableKey. The function
    returns only the name of the file, and expects the full filepath to be handled by
    the function caller.

    Parameters
    ----------
    uid: str, the UID of the DROP
    humanKey: str, a human-readable key (typically a truncated UID) for user-facing
        display

    Notes
    -----
    An example DROP UID would be:

        '2024-10-30T12:01:57_0140555b-8c23-4d6a-9e24-e16c15555e8c_0'

    This approach will lead to an abridged UID along with the humanKey appended:

       '2024-10-30T12:01:57_0140555b_0/1/1'

    In this case, 0/1/1 is the "humanKey", derived from the DALiuGE Translator
    constructs (For more information on humanKey generation, refer to
    dlg.common.truncateUidToKey).

    The final part of the method replaces characters that cannot be in filenames from
    the UIDs (e.g. "/").

    Returns
    -------
        str: Base filename
