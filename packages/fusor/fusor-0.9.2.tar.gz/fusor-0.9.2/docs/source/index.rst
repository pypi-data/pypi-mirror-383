FUSOR (FUSion Object Representation) is a Python package that provides modeling and validation tools for representing gene fusions in a flexible, computable structure. It implements data models and nomenclature generation utilities in support of the `Gene Fusion Specification <https://fusions.cancervariants.org/en/latest/>`_ developed by the `Variant Interpretation in Cancer Consortium <https://cancervariants.org/>`_.
