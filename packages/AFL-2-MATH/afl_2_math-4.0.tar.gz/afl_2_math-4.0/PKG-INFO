Before you start make sure you already run this command below:

```
pip install AFL_2_MATH
```
and this is example on how your code should look like
```python
from AFL_2_MATH import Himpunan #Very Important


# Create a set with mixed types: int, str, tuple, and another Himpunan
A = Himpunan(1, "a", (2, 3), ("x", "y"), [4, 5])
print(A)  # Output: {1, a, (2, 3), {x, y}, (4, 5)}

# Add and remove elements
A += "z"
A -= 1

# Set operations
B = Himpunan("a", (2, 3), "z")
print("Union:", A + B)
print("Intersection:", A / B)
print("Difference:", A - B)
print("Symmetric Difference:", A * B)
print("Cartesian Product:", A ** B)

# Power set and subsets
print("Power set size:", abs(A))
print("All subsets:", A.ListKuasa())
```
