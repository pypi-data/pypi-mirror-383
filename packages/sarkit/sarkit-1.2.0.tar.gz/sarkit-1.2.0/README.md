**SARkit** is a suite of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-related tools in Python developed and maintained by
Valkyrie Systems Corporation to encourage the use of National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) SAR data standards.

With SARkit, you can:

* read and write SAR standards files (CRSD, CPHD, SICD, SIDD)
* interact with SAR XML metadata using more convenient Python objects
* check SAR data/metadata files for inconsistencies

This project was developed as the modern successor to [SarPy](https://github.com/ngageoint/sarpy).
