# Hopper Disassembler Python API Type Stubs

## What is it?

These type stubs provide intelligent code completion, type checking, and enhanced developer
experience when writing automation scripts for Hopper. These stubs transform the scripting process from guesswork into a
confident, productive workflow by offering:

- **Smart Autocomplete**: Get instant suggestions for methods, properties, and classes as you type
- **Real-time Type Checking**: Catch errors before runtime with static type analysis
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Access comprehensive API documentation directly in your IDE
- **Improved Code Navigation**: Easily explore the Hopper API with reliable jump-to-definition features
- **Professional Development Experience**: Enjoy the same comfort of modern Python development tools

## Installation

```bash
pip install types-hopper-disassembler
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fi5t/hopper-disassembler-stubs.git
cd hopper-disassembler-stubs
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Once installed, your IDE will automatically provide type hints for Hopper scripts:

![autocomplete.png](assets/autocomplete.png)

```python
# type: ignore
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from hopper_api import Document, GlobalInformation

# Get type hints and autocomplete!
doc: Document = Document.getCurrentDocument()
version = GlobalInformation.getHopperVersion()

print(version)

for segment in doc.getSegmentsList():
    print(segment.getName())
```
