Boring Math - Special Functions
===============================

PyPI project
`boring-math-special-functions
<https://pypi.org/project/boring-math-special-functions>`_.

The purpose of this project is to compute special functions
of mathematics and Physics.

Initially these will be done in pure Python, but eventually I
would like to implement these in something like C, Zig or Rust.

This pypi project is part of the
`boring math
<https://grscheller.github.io/boring-math>`_ projects.
