# DEXPI Specificator

**dexpi.specificator** is a Python library and CLI tool that lets you generate DEXPI specifications in Python.  
It can be installed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) or [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) and used either as a library or a command-line tool to convert specification inputs into specification outputs.

---

## Features

- Parse input specification files in the DEXPI format
- Generate DEXPI outputs (XML, JSON, etc.) from those inputs
- Validate specifications against DEXPI schemas
- Tested with automated unit tests to ensure correctness
- Published on PyPI/TestPyPI for easy installation via `pip`

---
