"""
If we have a video placed in a timeline,
starting at the t=2s and the video lasts
2 seconds, the `t` time range in which the
video is playing is `[2s, 4s]`, so here 
you have some examples with global `t` 
values:
- `t=1`, the video is not playing because
it starts at `t=2`
- `t=3`, the video is playing, it started
at `t=2` and it has been playing during 1s
- `t=5`, the video is not playing because
it started at `t=2`, lasting 2s, so it
finished at `t=4`
