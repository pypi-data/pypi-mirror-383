* Windows x64 on 64-bit Intel and AMD processors
* macOS on 64-bit ARM processors
* macOS on 64-bit Intel processors

### Installation

The `teradatasql` package depends on the `pycryptodome` package which is available from PyPI.

Use `pip install` to download and install the driver and its dependencies automatically.

Platform       | Command
-------------- | ---
macOS or Linux | `pip install teradatasql`
Windows        | `py -3 -m pip install teradatasql`

When upgrading to a new version of the driver, you may need to use pip install's `--no-cache-dir` option to force the download of the new version.

Platform       | Command
-------------- | ---
macOS or Linux | `pip install --no-cache-dir -U teradatasql`
Windows        | `py -3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir -U teradatasql`

The `teradatasql` package depends on the `pycryptodome` package, because one of the included sample programs (`TJEncryptPassword.py`) uses `pycryptodome`. The driver itself does not use `pycryptodome`.

If you want to avoid installing `pycryptodome`, you can use the `--no-deps` option of pip install to avoid installing `pycryptodome`. Without `pycryptodome`, you will not be able to run the `TJEncryptPassword.py` sample program.

Platform       | Command
-------------- | ---
macOS or Linux | `pip install --no-deps teradatasql`
Windows        | `py -3 -m pip install --no-deps teradatasql`

### Documentation

Documentation and sample programs are [available from Teradata on github.com](https://github.com/Teradata/python-driver).

When the driver is installed, the `README.md` file is placed in the `teradatasql` directory under your Python installation directory. This permits you to view the documentation offline, when you are not connected to the Internet.

The `README.md` file is a plain text file containing the documentation for the driver. While the file can be viewed with any text file viewer or editor, your viewing experience will be best with an editor that understands Markdown format.
