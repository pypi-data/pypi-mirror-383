## Overview

A Bayesian network calculator designed for learning probabilistic reasoning using Bayesian networks. This tool allows you to define Bayesian networks, calculate probabilities, and perform various probabilistic operations using an efficient variable-elimination algorithm that scales well with network complexity.

## Features

- **Efficient Inference**: Uses variable elimination algorithm instead of exponentially-growing joint probability tables
- **Interactive REPL**: Command-line interface with tab completion and command history
- **Batch Processing**: Execute multiple queries from files or command strings
- **Rich Query Language**: Support for conditional probabilities, arithmetic expressions, and independence tests
- **Information Theory**: Built-in entropy, mutual information, and conditional entropy calculations
- **Network Analysis**: Graph structure analysis with parent/child relationships
- **Network Visualization**: Generate network diagrams with CPT tables (PDF, PNG, SVG)
- **Educational Focus**: Clear output formatting ideal for learning and teaching

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- NumPy >= 2.3.3
- prompt_toolkit >= 3.0.0
- graphviz >= 0.20.0 (for visualization)

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install bayescalc2
```

For visualization support install the `graphviz` system package:

```bash
# macOS
brew install graphviz

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install graphviz

# Fedora/Redhat
sudo dnf install graphviz

# Windows
# Download from https://graphviz.org/download/
```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johan162/bayescalc2.git
cd bayescalc2
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Download an example network
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johan162/bayescalc2/main/examples/rain_sprinkler_grass.net

# Launch interactive mode
bayescalc rain_sprinkler_grass.net

# Try some queries
>> P(Rain)
>> P(Rain|GrassWet=True)
>> entropy(Rain)
>> exit
```

## Usage

BayesCalc2 can be used in two modes:

### 1. Interactive Mode

```bash
bayescalc network_file.net
```

This launches an interactive REPL where you can enter probability queries and commands.

### 2. Batch Mode

```bash
bayescalc network_file.net --batch commands.txt
```

or

```bash
bayescalc network_file.net --cmd "P(Rain|GrassWet=Yes);printCPT(Rain)"
```

## Network File Format

Create a Bayesian network definition in a .net file:

```
# Example network definition
boolean Rain
variable Sprinkler {On, Off}
variable GrassWet {Yes, No}

# CPT definitions
Rain {
    P(True) = 0.2
    # P(False) will be auto-filled
}

Sprinkler | Rain {
    P(On | True) = 0.01
    P(On | False) = 0.4
    # P(Off | parent) auto-filled
}

GrassWet | Rain, Sprinkler {
    P(Yes | True, On) = 0.99
    P(Yes | True, Off) = 0.8
    P(Yes | False, On) = 0.9
    # Remaining CPTs auto-completed
}
```

## Available Commands

### Probability Queries
- `P(A)` - Marginal probability
- `P(A|B)` - Conditional probability  
- `P(A,B|C)` - Joint conditional probability
- `P(A|B)*P(B)/P(A)` - Arithmetic expressions

### Network Analysis
- `printCPT(X)` - Display conditional probability table
- `printJPT()` - Display joint probability table
- `parents(X)` - Show parent variables
- `children(X)` - Show child variables
- `showGraph()` - Display network structure
- `visualize(file.pdf)` - Generate network visualization with CPT tables
- `load(file.net)` - Load a different network file

### Independence Testing
- `isindependent(A,B)` - Test marginal independence
- `iscondindependent(A,B|C)` - Test conditional independence

### Information Theory
- `entropy(X)` - Shannon entropy
- `conditional_entropy(X|Y)` - Conditional entropy
- `mutual_information(X,Y)` - Mutual information

### Visualization Examples

```bash
# Generate PDF with CPT tables
>> visualize(network.pdf)

# Generate PNG without CPT tables
>> visualize(simple_network.png, show_cpt=False)

# Generate SVG with horizontal layout
>> visualize(network.svg, rankdir=LR)
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains various Bayesian networks demonstrating different use cases:

- `rain_sprinkler_grass.net` - Classic sprinkler example
- `medical_test.net` - The classical Medical diagnosis scenario 
- `student_network.net` - Academic performance model
- `asia_chest_clinic.net` - Medical expert system

## Use Cases

- **Education**: Teaching probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian networks
- **Research**: Prototyping and testing Bayesian models
- **Analysis**: Exploring conditional dependencies in data
- **Validation**: Verifying hand-calculated probability results
