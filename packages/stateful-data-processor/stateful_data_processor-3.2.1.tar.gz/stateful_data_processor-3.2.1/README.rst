=======================
stateful-data-processor
=======================

**stateful-data-processor** is a utility designed to handle large amounts of data incrementally. It allows you to process data step-by-step, saving progress to avoid data loss in case of interruptions or errors. The processor can be subclassed to implement custom data processing logic.

Features
--------

- Incrementally process large datasets.
- Save the processing state to a file.
- Resume the processing state and skip already processed items automatically
- Handle SIGINT and SIGTERM signals for graceful shutdown and state saving.
- Easily subclass to implement custom data processing.
- Reprocess items that were already stored into a file (explore alternative processing on cached data). 

Problem
=======
You have a large amount of data that you want to loop through and process incrementally.
Processing takes time, and in case an error occurs, you do not want to lose all the progress.
You want to save the data to a file and be able to continue processing from where you left off.
You also want to be able to interrupt the processing with a SIGINT signal and save the data to the file.
You want to be able to subclass the processor and implement the process_data and process_item methods.
You want to be able to iterate through items and process them one by one.

Solution
========

**StatefulDataProcessor** class to process data incrementally:

- **Incremental Processing**: Process large amounts of data in a JSON file incrementally.
- **Data Storage**: The data is stored in a dictionary, and the processor keeps track of the current step being processed.
- **Graceful Interruption**: The processor can be interrupted with a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, and the data will be saved to the file.
- **Subclassing**: The processor is meant to be subclassed, and the `process_item` method should be implemented.
- **Item Processing**: The `process_item` is being called with all arguments forwarded from `run`, except for `items`, which is unpacked and iterated item by item.
- **Unique Labels**: The data is be stored in a dictionary using unique labels corresponding to `items`. Thus, each `item` must be unique.
- **Customization**: The `process_data` method can be overridden for more customized processing of the items.


Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

   import time
   from stateful_data_processor.file_rw import FileRW
   from stateful_data_processor.processor import StatefulDataProcessor

   class MyDataProcessor(StatefulDataProcessor):

    def process_item(self, item, iteration_index: int, delay: float):
        ''' item and iteration_index are automatically supplied by the framework.
         iteration_index may or may not be used.
        '''
        self.data[item] = item ** 2  # Example processing: square the item
        time.sleep(delay)

   # Example usage
   file_rw = FileRW('data.json')
   processor = MyDataProcessor(file_rw)

   items_to_process = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   processor.run(items=items_to_process, delay=1.5)

The processor will handle SIGINT and SIGTERM signals to save the current state before exiting. Run your processor, and use Ctrl+C to send a SIGINT signal. When you run again, the processing will pick up from where
you left off. A logger is automatically created if you do not inject it into the constructor.

**Example usage in a large project:**

`alphaspread analysis of nasdaq symbols <https://github.com/doruirimescu/python-trading/blob/65a558fcb3a5e80a1686c58cbf35722e045c8f1e/Trading/stock/analyze_nasdaq.py#L22>`_

`filter ranging stocks <https://github.com/doruirimescu/python-trading/blob/master/Trading/live/range/filter_ranging_stocks.py>`_ 

`xtb to yfinance symbol conversion <https://github.com/doruirimescu/python-trading/blob/941055693ad64bfe8c843fed79429b6db2a4317d/Trading/symbols/yfinance/xtb_to_yfinance.py#L21>`_
