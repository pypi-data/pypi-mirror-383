## [0.0.18] - 2025-10-07

### Added

- **Merged upstream spec-kit v0.0.57**: Integrated all improvements from GitHub's spec-kit repository
- **Checklist command**: New `/sp.checklist` command for generating quality validation checklists
- **VS Code settings**: Added VS Code settings template for better IDE integration
- Improved command templates with better guidance and error handling
- Full Codex CLI support
- Enhanced command documentation and examples

### Changed

- **Command prefix**: Updated from `/speckit.` to `/sp.` for consistency with SpecifyPlus branding
- Improved templates for specify, plan, tasks, analyze, clarify, and implement commands
- Updated all documentation to use `/sp.` prefix
- Refined spec, plan, and tasks templates for better clarity
- Enhanced prerequisite checking in scripts

### Preserved

- All docs-plus/ educational content (100+ files)
- memory/ constitutional rules
- protocol-templates/ agent protocols  
- specifyplus and sp CLI commands
- ADR and PHR features
- Context7 integration
- Issue templates and workflows

### Changed

- All command files now prefixed with `speckit.` (e.g., `speckit.specify.md`, `speckit.plan.md`) for better discoverability and differentiation in IDE/CLI command palettes and file explorers

## [0.0.17] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- New `/clarify` command template to surface up to 5 targeted clarification questions for an existing spec and persist answers into a Clarifications section in the spec.
- New `/analyze` command template providing a non-destructive cross-artifact discrepancy and alignment report (spec, clarifications, plan, tasks, constitution) inserted after `/tasks` and before `/implement`.
	- Note: Constitution rules are explicitly treated as non-negotiable; any conflict is a CRITICAL finding requiring artifact remediation, not weakening of principles.

## [0.0.16] - 2025-09-22
