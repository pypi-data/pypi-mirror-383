    Metric that computes the proportion of runs that reached the :math:`f`-target value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sols : List
        The solutions returned by a solver during multiple runs.
    f : Callable
        The objective function.

        The bounds of the search space.
    p : float
        The proportion.
