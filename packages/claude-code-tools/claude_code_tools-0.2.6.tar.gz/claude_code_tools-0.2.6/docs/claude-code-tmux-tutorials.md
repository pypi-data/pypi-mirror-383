## Video Resources

While video content is limited, these stand out for advanced techniques:

**"Claude Code / OpenCode + T-Mux + Worktrees: This SELF-SPAWNING AI Coder TEAM is INSANITY!"**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWKHPelgNgs  
11-minute demonstration of combining Claude Code with tmux and Git Worktrees to create a self-spawning AI coder team. Covers task claiming systems, agent-spawn workflow automation, and monitoring multiple AI agents in tmux sessions.

**"【AI組織実現‼️Claude Code Organization】現役エンジニアが「5人のAIが勝手に開発する会社」の作り方を解説！"**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qxus36eijkM  
Japanese tutorial demonstrating advanced AI organization with hierarchical agent structures (President → Manager → Worker) using tmux session management and mouse operation configuration.

## Production-Ready Tools and GitHub Projects

### Claude Squad - Complete Multi-Agent Management
https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad  
The most mature solution for managing multiple Claude Code agents. Uses tmux for isolated terminal sessions with git worktrees for separate codebases. Features include TUI interface, auto-accept mode for background tasks, and support for multiple AI agents (Claude Code, Aider, Codex).

### tmux-mcp - Model Context Protocol Server
https://github.com/nickgnd/tmux-mcp  
Enables Claude Desktop to interact programmatically with tmux sessions. Features include listing/searching tmux sessions, viewing and navigating windows/panes, executing commands, and creating new sessions. Essential for deep tmux integration.

### Advanced Configuration Scripts

**Task Master Agent Spawner**  
https://gist.github.com/worksfornow/df0cb6c4f6fd4966cd17133bc711fd20  
Sophisticated Claude Code slash command for parallel task delegation. Creates multiple worktrees and launches Claude agents in tmux sessions with automated status tracking and branch management.

## Key Integration Patterns and Workflows

### Multi-Agent Parallelization Pattern
- Use git worktrees + tmux sessions for parallel agent execution
- Each agent gets an isolated directory and tmux session
- Example command: `tmux new-session -d -s "agent-<task_id>" -c "worktrees/<feature_name>" claude`

### Terminal Orchestration Pattern
Brian P. Hogan's recommendation: "Use tmux. Have a pane with Claude Code and use tmux with a big scrollback buffer. Then have another pane where you run Git commands and other shell commands."

### Session Persistence Pattern
- Implement persistent tmux sessions for Claude Code context preservation
- Tools like "claunch" provide project-specific session management
- Critical for maintaining context across disconnections

### MCP Integration Pattern
- Use Model Context Protocol servers for programmatic tmux control
- tmux-mcp server enables Claude Desktop to read and control tmux sessions
- Allows AI assistants to observe and interact with terminal sessions

## Advanced Techniques Summary

The resources reveal several sophisticated techniques:

1. **Hierarchical Agent Organization**: Using tmux panes to create boss-worker relationships between multiple Claude Code instances
2. **Automated Worktree Management**: Scripts that automatically create git worktrees and spawn Claude Code instances in dedicated tmux sessions
3. **Session Orchestration**: Tools for managing dozens of parallel Claude Code sessions with monitoring and merging capabilities
4. **Mobile Development Workflows**: Using tmux for persistent remote Claude Code sessions accessible from mobile devices
5. **Custom Slash Commands**: Creating project-specific delegation commands that leverage tmux for task distribution

## Notable Gaps

The research reveals that while basic tmux + Claude Code integration is well-documented, there's still room for more comprehensive English-language video tutorials covering complex tmux layout management, detailed multiplexing features, and live coding sessions with sophisticated setups.

These resources represent the cutting edge of tmux + Claude Code integration, focusing on advanced techniques that leverage tmux's multiplexing capabilities to enhance Claude Code workflows significantly beyond basic usage.
