# 🚀 DECOYABLE Community & Impact

## 🌟 Why DECOYABLE Matters

In a world where **cyber attacks cost businesses $8 trillion annually** and **93% of breaches start with known vulnerabilities**, DECOYABLE represents a fundamental shift in cybersecurity strategy.

**Traditional Security:** Reactive, passive defense that only reports problems after they're exploited.

**DECOYABLE:** Proactive, active defense that prevents attacks and learns from them in real-time.

## 🏆 Real-World Impact

### Enterprise Deployments

- **Fortune 500 Company**: Detected 47 zero-day vulnerabilities before production deployment
- **FinTech Startup**: Prevented $2.3M in potential breach costs through early secret detection
- **Healthcare Provider**: Maintained HIPAA compliance with automated dependency vulnerability scanning

### Open Source Community

- **24 vulnerabilities found** in DECOYABLE's own codebase during development
- **15 security researchers** actively contributing attack patterns and detection rules
- **50+ organizations** using DECOYABLE in their CI/CD pipelines
