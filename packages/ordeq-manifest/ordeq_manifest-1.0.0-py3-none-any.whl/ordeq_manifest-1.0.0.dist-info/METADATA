# ordeq-manifest

This package can be used to produce a manifest of an Ordeq project.
The manifest is a reproducible representation of the project.
It contains project metadata, such as which nodes and IOs are used.

The primary purpose of the manifest is to support Ordeq extensions, like `ordeq-viz` and `ordeq-airflow`.
For instance, `ordeq-viz` can use the manifest to create a visualization of the project.
Similarly, `ordeq-airflow` can use the manifest to create Airflow DAGs.

## Installation
