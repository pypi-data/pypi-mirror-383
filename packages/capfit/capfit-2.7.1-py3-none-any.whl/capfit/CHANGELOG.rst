---------

V2.7.1: MC, Oxford, 13 October 2025
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Allow for either ``ftol`` or ``xtol`` to be ``None`` as documented.

V2.7.0: MC, Oxford, 21 July 2025
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Introduced the ``format_values_with_errors`` class for formatting parameter
  values and errors for plot display.
- Updated ``capfit_examples.py`` to utilize this formatting class.

V2.6.6: MC, Oxford, 24 February 2025
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Simplified import: Use ``import capfit`` or ``from capfit import lsq_box``.
- Removed the ``linear_method`` keyword from ``capfit``. Now, if inequality
  constraints are present and ``cvxopt`` is installed, it is used; otherwise,
  defaults to ``lsq_lin``.

V2.6.5: MC, Oxford, 05 August 2024
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Removed ``capfit`` from the ``ppxf`` package and made it a separated package.
- ``capfit``: Introduced the new keyword ``monitor`` to define a user function
  for optimization monitoring.

V2.5.1: MC, Oxford, 22 May 2023
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``capfit``: Relaxed tolerance when checking initial guess feasibility.

V2.5.0: MC, Oxford, 16 August 2022
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Uses ``scipy.optimize.linprog`` to find feasible starting point in ``lsq_lin``.
- Set default ``linear_method='lsq_lin'`` in ``capfit``. This eliminates the
  need to install ``cvxopt`` when using general linear constraints.

V2.4.0: MC, Oxford, 04 March 2022
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Remove the non-free variables before the optimization.
  This reduces the degeneracy of the Jacobian.

V2.3.0: MC, Oxford, 20 December 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- New ``linear_method`` keyword to select ``cvxopt`` or ``lsq_lin``,
  for cases where the latter stops, when using linear constraints.
  Thanks to Kyle Westfall (UCO Lick) for a detailed bug report.

V2.2.1: MC, Oxford, 11 September 2020
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed possible infinite loop in ``lsq_box`` and ``lsq_lin``.
  Thanks to Shravan Shetty (pku.edu.cn) for the detailed report.
- Use NumPy rather than SciPy version of ``linalg.lstsq`` to avoid
  a Scipy bug in the default criterion for rank deficiency.
- Pass ``rcond`` keyword to ``cov_err`` for consistency.

V2.2.0: MC, Oxford, 20 August 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- New function ``lsq_lin`` implementing a robust linear least-squares
  linearly-constrained algorithm which works with a rank-deficient matrix and
  allows for a starting guess. ``lsq_lin`` supersedes the former ``lsqlin``.
- Renamed ``lsqbox`` to ``lsq_box`` and revised its interface.

V2.1.0: MC, Oxford, 09 July 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- New function ``lsqbox`` implementing a fast linear least-squares
  box-constrained (bounds) algorithm which allows for a starting guess.

V2.0.2: MC, Oxford, 20 June 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``capfit``: new keyword ``cond`` (passed to ``lsqlin``).
- ``capfit``: Use ``bvls`` to solve quadratic subproblem with only ``bounds``.

V2.0.1: MC, Oxford, 24 January 2020
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- New keyword ``cond`` for ``lsqlin``.
- Relaxed assertion for inconsistent inequalities in ``lsqlin`` to avoid false
  positives. Thanks to Kyle Westfall (UCO Lick) for a detailed bug report.

V2.0.0: MC, Oxford, 10 January 2020
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Use the new general linear least-squares optimization
  function ``lsqlin`` to solve the quadratic sub-problem.
- Allow for linear inequality/equality constraints
  ``A_ineq``, ``b_ineq`` and  ``A_eq``, ``b_eq``

V1.0.7: MC, Oxford, 10 October 2019
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Included complete documentation.
- Improved print formatting.
- Return ``.message`` attribute.
- Improved ``xtol`` convergence test.
- Only accept the final move if ``chi2`` decreases.
- Strictly satisfy bounds during Jacobian computation.

V1.0.6: MC, Oxford, 11 June 2019
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Use only free parameters for small-step convergence tests.
- Explain in words convergence status when ``verbose != 0``
- Fixed program stops when ``abs_step`` is undefined.
- Fixed capfit ignoring optional ``max_nfev``.

V1.0.5: MC, Oxford, 28 March 2019
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Raise an error if the user function returns non-finite values.

V1.0.4: MC, Oxford, 30 November 2018
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Allow for a scalar ``abs_step``.

V1.0.3: MC, Oxford, 20 September 2018
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Raise an error if one tries to tie parameters to themselves.
  Thanks to Kyle Westfall (Univ. Santa Cruz) for the feedback.
- Use Python 3.6 f-strings.

V1.0.2: MC, Oxford, 10 May 2018
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Dropped legacy Python 2.7 support.

V1.0.1: MC, Oxford, 13 February 2018
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Make output errors of non-free variables exactly zero.

V1.0.0: MC, Oxford, 15 June 2017
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
