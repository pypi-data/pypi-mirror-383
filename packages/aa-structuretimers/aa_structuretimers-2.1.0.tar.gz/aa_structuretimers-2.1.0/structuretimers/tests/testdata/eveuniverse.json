The materials used to finish the Palatine Keepstar citadel, inside and out, are of highest quality and the design includes some key enhancements aimed at pushing the capabilities of this combination fortress and symbol of power to the utmost. The Palatine Keepstar is being offered under terms of a highly encrypted construction template that will limit the number that can be built and operated at any given time.\r\n\r\nLike the standard Keepstar, the Palatine Keepstar has been built with new spaceship tethering technology as standard, and it will accommodate all size classes of ship, including 'supercapital' vessels, in its internal docking bays. The defensive capabilities of the Palatine Keepstar are formidable and are highly enhanced in lower security star systems with the ability to mount area effect and 'doomsday' weapons. The Palatine Keepstar can be configured using Upwell's Standup brand service and structure modules so as to serve the specific needs of the structure operator. Further adjustment of the hardware of the Palatine Keepstar can be achieved by installed Standup XL-Set rigs to optimize the specific role of the citadel.\r\n\r\nOn June 14th YC125 CONCORD updated the capsuleer structure regulations to disallow the anchoring of any new XL structures in highsec space. XL structures that were anchored before this date will not be affected by this change unless they are unanchored.",
