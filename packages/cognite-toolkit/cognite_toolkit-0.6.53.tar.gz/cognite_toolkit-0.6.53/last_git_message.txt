[CDF-25910] Capabilities update by project type (#2055)

# Description

DM only projects does not require `AssetsAcl` and `RelationshipsAcl`.
This PR intends to fix the error users are facing while running `cdf
auth init`:

```
cognite.client.exceptions.CogniteAPIError: 2 invalid capabilitie(s) are present: {"assetsAcl":{"actions":["READ","WRITE"],"scope":{"all":{}}}} (invalid capability - write access to the legacy Assets API is restricted), {"relationshipsAcl":{"actions":["READ","WRITE"],"scope":{"all":{}}}} (invalid capability - write access to the legacy Relationships API is restricted) | code: 400 | X-Request-ID: XXXXXXXXXXXX | cluster: XXXXXXXXX | project: XXX-XXX
The API Failed to process some items.
Successful (2xx): 0
Unknown (5xx): 0
Failed (4xx): 1
```

A check is introduced which bypasses addition of `AssetsAcl` and
`RelationshipsAcl` if project is DM only.
