[CDF-25858] Enable statistics on deployment packs (#2033)

# Description

Maintainers of external module (a.k.a. deployment pack) libraries want
to track the usage through the Toolkit in Mixpanel. They will want to
know when deployment packs are _installed_, _built_ and _deployed_.

This PR

- extends module data-classes so that it is possible to tag them with
identifiers (package and module)
- extends tracking in`ToolkitCommand` so that its subclasses can have
additional values added to the emitted Mixpanel event.
- uses this approach in the BuildCommand to include package and module
ids to the Mixpanel event
