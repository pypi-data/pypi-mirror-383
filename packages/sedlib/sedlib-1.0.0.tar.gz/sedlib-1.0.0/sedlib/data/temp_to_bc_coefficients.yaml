# Coefficients for Bolometric Correction Calculations
#
# This file contains the polynomial coefficients (with uncertainties) used to compute
# the bolometric correction (BC) for stars based on their temperature. The bolometric
# correction is determined via a fourth-order polynomial fit of the form:
#
#     BC = a + b*T + c*T^2 + d*T^3 + e*T^4
#
# which can be efficiently evaluated using Horner's method:
#
#     BC = a + T*(b + T*(c + T*(d + T*e)))
#
# Each photometric filter (e.g., B, V, G, GBP, GRP, TESS) has its own set of coefficients.
# The coefficients are expressed as pairs [nominal value, uncertainty] and are intended to be
# converted to ufloat objects (using the Python uncertainties package) to properly propagate
# errors during calculations.
#
# These coefficients are based on the methodology described in:
