# ThoughtSpot TML Examples

## Basic examples 
If writing your own scripts using thoughtspot_tml, look to these two examples along with the README to understand basic functionality and workflows:

- *basic_input_output.py*: small sample functions showing the .load and .loads methods and the .dump and .dumps methods for going from TML files to library objects and back
- *common_attribute_changes.py*: small sample functions on the most common TML objects showing the properties that are typically changed when doing TML manipulation, and the syntax for how to access any other properties
