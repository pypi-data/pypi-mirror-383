License: #ThoughtSpot Development Tools End User License Agreement
        
        THIS THOUGHTSPOT DEVELOPMENT TOOLS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (“EULA”) FORMS A BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU INDIVIDUALLY OR THE BUSINESS ENTITY OR PUBLIC AGENCY ON WHOSE BEHALF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT (“COMPANY”) AND THOUGHTSPOT, INC. (“THOUGHTSPOT”). THIS EULA DESCRIBES THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF COMPANY AND THOUGHTSPOT GOVERNING THE USE OF ANY APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE, CONNECTOR, SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT, CODE SNIPPET, SAMPLE CODE, FREE CUSTOM USER INTERFACE OR VISUALIZATION, SAMPLE DATA, AND THE CORRESPONDING DOCUMENTATION FOR EACH, ANY UPDATES AND UPGRADES THERETO, AND ANY MODIFICATIONS, ENHANCEMENTS, OR IMPROVEMENTS, OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING, MADE AVAILABLE BY THOUGHTSPOT TOGETHER WITH THIS EULA (EACH A “TOOL” AND COLLECTIVELY “TOOLS”).
        
        THIS EULA IS ACCEPTED BY: (1) INDICATING ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS BY CLICKING “SUBMIT,” “ACCEPT” OR A SIMILAR BUTTON WHEN THIS EULA IS REFERENCED ON A WEB PAGE TO RECEIVE A TOOL; OR (2) DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR USING, ANY PORTION OF THE TOOL. THE INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF COMPANY REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT HE OR SHE: (A) IS AN EMPLOYEE, CONTRACTOR, OR AGENT OF, AND HAS THE AUTHORITY TO REPRESENT, COMPANY; AND (B) HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS ALL THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF COMPANY DOES NOT WISH TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTING THE AGREEMENT DOES NOT HAVE AUTHORITY TO BIND COMPANY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THEN DO NOT CLICK OR SIGN TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, OR DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR USE, ANY TOOL.
        
        In the event of any conflict between the terms of this EULA and a signed agreement between Company and ThoughtSpot, the terms of the signed agreement will apply.
        
        ACKNOWLEDGMENT. ThoughtSpot provides the Tool to Company “as is” and “as available” and as an accommodation to Company to more quickly connect third-party software or services with, utilize sample data or code on, or utilize sample data sets or other materials with, the search and analytics ThoughtSpot Cloud subscription service or ThoughtSpot Application licensed software, to which Company must have purchased the necessary use rights pursuant to a separate purchase agreement (“Agreement”). ThoughtSpot may at any time remove Company’s access to any Tool or terminate the availability of a Tool without any liability to Company or any third party. In the event of termination, Company must remove and destroy all copies of the affected Tool, including all backup copies from all devices Company owns, possesses or controls and on which the Tool is installed.
        
        LICENSE SCOPE. Subject to Company’s compliance with this EULA, ThoughtSpot hereby grants to Company a royalty-free, sub-licensable, transferable, non-exclusive, worldwide right and license to use, reproduce, display, perform, import and export, the Tool. The Tool is licensed, not sold.
        
        RESTRICTIONS. Company will not (and has no license to): (a) use the Tool except as permitted in this EULA; (b) sell, resell, license, sublicense, rent, lease, encumber, lend, distribute, transfer, or provide a third party with access to the Tool; (c) modify, or create derivative works of the Tool; (d) circumvent or remove by any means any click-accept or copy protection used by ThoughtSpot in connection with the Tool; (e) use the Tool to conduct competitive research, to develop a product that is competitive with any ThoughtSpot product offering, or otherwise if Company is a competitor to ThoughtSpot, or to assert, authorize, assist, or encourage a third-party to assert, against ThoughtSpot or any of its affiliates, customers, vendors, business partners, or licensors, any patent or other intellectual property claim regarding ThoughtSpot products or services; (f) publicly disseminate any performance or security vulnerability test (including a penetration test) results or analysis related to or derived from the Tool; (g) use the Tool to create a product that converts ThoughtSpot products’ file formats for use with data analysis, machine learning, or data visualization software that is not the property of ThoughtSpot; (h) use the Tool to access ThoughtSpot products in a manner not authorized by the Agreement or this EULA; (i) use the Tool in any manner that violates any applicable laws or regulations; or (j) to the extent that the Tool includes a third-party application programming interface, then Company will not modify, distribute, or use, the Tool with anything other than to connect the intended corresponding third-party technology to ThoughtSpot’s products.

ThoughtSpot may, in its discretion, provide alternatives that reduce adverse impacts to ThoughtSpot’s intellectual property or other rights.
        
        OPEN SOURCE COMPONENTS. A Tool may include one or more open source software components provided under separate license terms which can be found in the open source disclosure file provided with or within a Tool download. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, open source software is licensed to Company under such OSS’s own applicable license terms, which can be found in the attribution file. The open source license terms are consistent with the license granted in this EULA, and may contain additional rights benefiting Company. The open source license terms shall take precedence over this EULA to the extent that this EULA imposes greater restrictions on Company than the applicable open source license terms. To the extent the license for any open source software requires ThoughtSpot to make available to Company the corresponding source code and/or modifications, Company may obtain a copy of the applicable source files by sending a written request, with Company’s name and address to: ThoughtSpot, Inc., 910 Hermosa Court, Sunnyvale, California 94085, United States of America. All requests should clearly specify: Open Source Files Request, Attention: General Counsel. This offer to obtain a copy of such source files is valid for three years from the date Company acquired the applicable Tool.
        
        THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS. In addition to open source components, a Tool may include one or more components licensed by a third party (a “Component”) (e.g., an application programming interface or a sample data set). To the extent that third-party license requirements apply to a third-party component in a Tool, such additional license terms will be provided in the open source disclosure file provided with or within a Tool download. Third-party license terms shall take precedence over this EULA to the extent that they impose additional restrictions or limitations on Company than the license provided herein for download and use of a Component. The parties agree that: (a) to the extent that the terms between Company and the third party for use of a third-party technology accessed by the Component are more restrictive, such terms shall apply to Company’s use of the Component; (b) ThoughtSpot, and not the third party, is responsible for the Component including, without limitation, for any warranties, maintenance, and support thereof, and the third party does not warrant the Component’s accuracy, reliability, completeness, usefulness, non-infringement, or quality of the Component, and will not be liable for any losses or damages of any kind, including lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages, relating to use of or reliance on the Component; and (c) the third party owns all right, title, and interest in and to the Component, including all intellectual property rights therein.
        
        DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. THOUGHTSPOT DISCLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY HARM RESULTING FROM COMPANY’S USE OF THIS TOOL. THOUGHTSPOT DISCLAIMS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED, ALL GUARANTEES AND EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, AND ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY, SECURITY, RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS TOOL. COMPANY DOWNLOADS AND USES THIS TOOL AT ITS OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND COMPANY IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO ITS HARDWARE DEVICES OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULT FROM THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF THIS TOOL.

All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
        
        INDEMNIFICATION. Company will indemnify and hold harmless ThoughtSpot from any claim made by any third party due to or arising directly or indirectly out of its conduct or any connection with its use of this Tool, violation of the terms herein, and any violation of any applicable law or regulation. ThoughtSpot reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any manner subject to indemnification by Company, but doing so will not excuse Company’s indemnity obligations.
        
        LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THOUGHTSPOT AND ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE PRECEDING LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO COMPANY. THOUGHTSPOT’S AND ITS LICENSORS’ LIABILITY UNDER THIS EULA WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED $100 USD. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THOUGHTSPOT OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
        
        LEGAL COMPLIANCE. A Tool may be subject to United States export control regulations. Without prior authorization from the United States government, Company shall not use the Tool for, and shall not permit the Tool to be used for, any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, for any prohibited development, design, manufacture or production of missiles or nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. Without limiting the foregoing, Company represents and warrants that: (a) Company is not, and is not acting on behalf of, any person who is a citizen, national, or resident of, or who is controlled by the government of, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria, the Crimea Region, or any other country to which the United States has prohibited export transactions; (b) Company is not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (c) Company is not, and is not acting on behalf of, any person or entity listed on the U.S. Treasury Department list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, or the U.S. Commerce Department Denied Persons List, Unverified List, or Entity List or any other U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties unless authorized by license or regulation. In addition, Company is responsible for complying with any local Law that may impact Company’s right to import, export, or use the Tool.
        
        U.S. GOVERNMENT USE. If a Tool provided under this Agreement is software, then it is commercial computer software developed exclusively at private expense.

🚨 __If your examples or scripts are built on__ `thoughtspot_tml==1.3.0`__, see our [Migration to v2.0.0](#migration-to-v200) guide__. 🚨
</div>

## Features

 - __Supports__: Connections, [Tables][syntax-table], [Views][syntax-view], [SQLViews][syntax-sqlview], [Worksheets][syntax-worksheet], [Answers][syntax-answer], [Liveboards][syntax-liveboard]
 - Deep attribute access
 - Roundtripping from text or file
 - Utilities for [disambiguation][docs-fqn] workflows

*This package will not perform validation of the constructed TML files or interact with your* __ThoughtSpot__ *cluster!*

Please leverage the [__ThoughtSpot__ REST API][rest-api] for this purpose.

## Installation

`thoughtspot_tml` requires at least __Python 3.7__, *preferably* __Python 3.9__ and above.

__Installation is as simple as:__
```shell
pip install thoughtspot-tml
```

## Upgrade library after ThoughtSpot is upgraded
If you have errors using the `.load()` method on a TML file directly exported with no modification from ThoughtSpot, please upgrade to the latest `thoughtpot_tml` version.

New attributes may have been added to the TML specification that are not present in the older version of `thoughtspot_tml` library you have installed.

## A Basic Example

This example creates a command-line tool for changing the prefix in the names of the Table objects that a Worksheet object connects to.

```python
# worksheet_remapping.py
from thoughtspot_tml import Worksheet
import argparse
import pathlib


def filepath(fp: str) -> pathlib.Path:
    """
    Converts a string to a pathlib.Path.
    """
    path = pathlib.Path(fp)

    if not path.exists():
        raise argparse.ArgumentTypeError(f"path '{fp!r}' does not exist")

    if not path.is_file():
        raise argparse.ArgumentValueError(f"path must be a file, got '{fp!r}'")

    return path


def main():
    # Create a command line application
    #   - argument for a WORKSHEET.worksheet.tml
    #   - options for the "before" and "after" tabling naming conventions
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("worksheet_tml", help="a worksheet.tml to remap", type=filepath)
    parser.add_argument("-s", "--src-prefix", metavar="SRC", default="DEV_", type=str, help="(default: %(default)s)")
    parser.add_argument("-d", "--dst-prefix", metavar="DST", default="TEST_", type=str, help="(default: %(default)s)")

    # Parse CLI input
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Read from file
    tml = Worksheet.load(args.worksheet_tml)

    # Replace instances of DEV_ with TEST_
    for table in tml.worksheet.tables:
        table.name = table.name.replace(args.src_prefix, args.dst_prefix)

    # Save to file
    tml.dump(args.worksheet_tml)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    raise SystemExit(main())

```

```shell
>>> python worksheet_remapping.py -h

usage: [-h] [-s SRC] [-d DST] worksheet_tml

positional arguments:
  worksheet_tml         a worksheet.tml to remap

options:
  -h, --help                show this help message and exit
  -s SRC, --src-prefix SRC  (default: DEV_)
  -d DST, --dst-prefix DST  (default: TEST_)
```

A more complex version of this example, as well as more examples can be found in the [/examples directory][examples] in this repository.

### TML Objects
```python
from thoughtspot_tml import Table, View, SQLView, Worksheet
from thoughtspot_tml import Answer, Liveboard

# aliases
from thoughtspot_tml import ThoughtSpotView    # View
from thoughtspot_tml import SavedAnswer        # Answer
from thoughtspot_tml import SystemTable        # Table
```

Each TML object has a top-level attribute for the globally unique identifier, or `GUID`, as well as the document form of the object it represents. This identically mirrors the TML specification you can find [in the __ThoughtSpot__ documentation][syntax-tml]. In addition, the `name` attribute of the TML document itself has been pulled into the top-level namespace.

```python
@dataclass
class Worksheet(TML):
    """
    Representation of a ThoughtSpot Worksheet TML.
    """

    guid: GUID
    worksheet: WorksheetEDocProto

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return self.worksheet.name
```

The full, composable TML specification can found in [`_scriptability.py`][py-scriptability]. Each piece of the spec is a python [`dataclasses.dataclass` field][py-dataclasses-field]. The internal `_scriptability.py` module is generated code from the __ThoughtSpot__'s internal architecture and allows for `thoughtspot_tml` to offer the deep attribute access experience in python.

```python
@dataclass
class Table(TML):
    """
    Representation of a ThoughtSpot Table TML.
    """

    guid: GUID
    table: LogicalTableEDocProto

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return self.table.name
```

For example, interesting attributes about the Table TML spec are exposed via attributes which can, in turn expose their own attributes themselves. This functionality offers common pattersn to be expressed natively in Python, such as remapping a Table's connection details.

```python
tml = Table.load("tests/data/DUMMY.table.tml")

# get the Table document object
tml.table           # => LogicalTableEdocProto(...)

# get the Table's underlying connected details
tml.table.db        # => 'PMMDB'
tml.table.schema    # => 'RETAILAPPAREL'
tml.table.db_table  # => 'dim_retapp_products'

# get the Table's columns
tml.table.columns   # => [LogicalTableEDocProtoLogicalColumnEDocProto(...), ...]

# repoint this ThoughtSpot Table to a new external table
tml.table.schema = "RETAILAPPAREL_V2"
tml.table.db_table = "DIM_RETAPP_PRODUCTS"
```

---

Connections (also known as "Embrace" Connections) were implemented prior to the TML spec being officially released. The remapping file (`connection.yaml`), obtained from your platform at `Data > Connections > (...) in the top right > Remapping > Download` defines how __ThoughtSpot__ table objects relate to their external counterparts.

```python
from thoughtspot_tml import Connection

# aliases
from thoughtspot_tml import EmbraceConnection  # Connection
```

The Connection GUID, while optional in `thoughtspot_tml`, is required when modifying or removing an existing connection via the REST API. A Connection's GUID can be obtained by calling the [`connection/list`][rest-api-cnxn-list] endpoint.

When loading from a `connection.yaml` file, if `thoughtspot_tml` identifies the filename is a GUID, then the property will be set on the resulting object.

The [`connection/update`][rest-api-cnxn-update] REST API endpoint requires connections to formatted in a different way. For this, we provide a method to generate the metadata parameter data, which is a mapping of configuration attributes, as well as database, schema, and table objects.

```python
@dataclass
class Connection(TML):
    """
    Representation of a ThoughtSpot Connection YAML.
    """

    guid: Optional[GUID]
    connection: ConnectionDoc

    def to_rest_api_v1_metadata(self) -> ConnectionMetadata:
        ...
```

Each object contains multiple methods for serialization and deserialization.

### __Deserialization__

For deserialization of a TML document into a python object.

```python
ws = Worksheet.load(path: PathLike = "tests/data/DUMMY.worksheet.tml")
ws = Worksheet.loads(tml_document: str = ...)  # can be obtained from the ThoughtSpot REST API

ws.guid == "2ea7add9-0ccb-4ac1-90bb-231794ebb377"
```

`.load` a worksheet from a `.worksheet.tml` file, or as a string directly from the [`metadata/tml/export`][rest-api-export] API with `.loads`.

---

### __Serialization__

For serialization of a TML python object back into data.

```python
data = ws.to_dict()
data["guid"] == "2ea7add9-0ccb-4ac1-90bb-231794ebb377"

ws.dump(path="tests/data/DUMMY.worksheet.tml")
# DUMMY.worksheet.tml
#
# guid: 2ea7add9-0ccb-4ac1-90bb-231794ebb377
# worksheet:
#   ...

data_s = ws.dumps(format_type="YAML")
data = yaml.load(data_s)
data["guid"] == "2ea7add9-0ccb-4ac1-90bb-231794ebb377"

# -or-

data = ws.dumps(format_type="JSON")
data_s = json.loads(data_s)
data["guid"] == "2ea7add9-0ccb-4ac1-90bb-231794ebb377"
```

`.to_dict` to convert the entire object tree into python native types, or write back to a file with `.dump` as a TML-formatted string. The formatting can be overriden to JSON if the JSON file type is used (`.worksheet.json`). `.dumps` allows access to the formatted string directly, typically used as input for the [`metadata/tml/import`][rest-api-import] API.

### SpotApp

```python
from thoughtspot_tml import SpotApp
```

SpotApps are bundles of TML which can be obtained directly from the __ThoughtSpot__ user interace as a zip file archive or from the [`/metadata/tml/export`][rest-api-export] API endpoint using the `export_associated = true` query parameter.


```python
export_response = ...  # /metadata/tml/export
s = SpotApp.from_api(export_response)
print(s.tml)  # => [Worksheet(...), Table(...), Table(...)]
print(s.manifest)  # => Manifest(...)

# -or-

s = SpotApp.read("tests/data/DUMMY_spot_app.zip")
print(s.tml)  # => [Worksheet(...), Table(...), Table(...)]
print(s.manifest)  # => Manifest(...)
```

SpotApps can also be saved to a new zipfile archive through the `.save` method.

```python
s = SpotApp.read("tests/data/DUMMY_spot_app.zip")
s.save("tests/data/NEW_DUMMY_spot_app.zip")
```

`thoughtspot_tml.utils` are additional methods which can help or speed up working with TML documents.


### `determine_tml_type`

TML is both a data structure and file format, and these formats vary slightly across each document. `determine_tml_type` will return the appropriate TML class so that you can call [deserialization methods](#deserialization) directly. Pass either the `path` keyword with a filepath, or the file info directly from one of the objects returned in the [`/metadata/tml/export`][rest-api-export] response data.

<b> &emsp; &emsp; signature</b>

```python
def determine_tml_type(*, info: TMLDocInfo = None, path: PathLike = None) -> Union[Connection, TMLObject]:
    """
    Get the appropriate TML class based on input data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    info : TMLDocInfo
      API edoc info response

    path : PathLike
      filepath to parse

    Raises
    ------
    TMLError, when a valid TML type could not be found based on input
    """
```

<b> &emsp; &emsp; usage</b>

```python
from thoughtspot_tml.utils import determine_tml_type

tml_cls = determine_tml_type(path="/tests/data/DUMMY.worksheet.tml")
tml = tml_cls.load(path="/tests/data/DUMMY.worksheet.tml")
type(tml) is Worksheet  # => True

# -or-

export_response = ...  # /metadata/tml/export
tml_cls = determine_tml_type(info=export_response["object"][0]["info"])
tml = tml_cls.loads(tml_document=export_response["object"][0]["edoc"])
type(tml) is Worksheet  # => True
```


### `EnvironmentGUIDMapper`

The `EnvironmentGUIDMapper` is a dictionary-like data structure which can help you maintain references to objects across your __ThoughtSpot__ environments. The underlying data structure is intended to clearly show the relationship of a given object between any number of environments. An "environment" can be any scope you consider separate from each other, be it 2 __ThoughtSpot__ servers, 2 Connections on the same server, or even "Copy of" the same object within a single Connection.

<b> &emsp; &emsp; signature</b>

```python
class EnvironmentGUIDMapper:
    """
    Attributes
    ----------
    environment_transformer : Callable(str) -> str

### `disambiguate`

In __ThoughtSpot__, the uniqueness constraint exists on the underlying object's `guid`. This means that there can be multiple objects of the same type with the same name. An example of this is maintaining both a DEV and PROD Connection. All the development work happens on one set of objects (that are not shared with any of the End User community), while the production connection contains objects with identical names that *are* shared with the End User community.

To reduce ambiguity, you may need to add the `fqn` key to your TML document when you reference source tables or connections. If you do not add the `fqn` key, and the connection or table you reference does not have a unique name, the import will fail.

__NOTE__: *Prior to __ThoughtSpot__ V8.7.0, TML does not export with the `fqn` automatically.*

<b> &emsp; &emsp; signature</b>

```python
def disambiguate(
    tml: TMLObject,
    *,
    guid_mapping: Dict[str, GUID],
    remap_object_guid: bool = True,
    delete_unmapped_guids: bool = False,
) -> TMLObject:
    """
    Deep scan the TML looking for fields to add FQNs to.

    This will explore the top-level guid and all nested objects looking on
    Tables, Worksheets, etc to disambiguate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tml : TMLObject
      the tml to scan

    guid_mapping : {str: GUID}
      a mapping of names or guids, to the FQN to add to the object

    remap_object_guid : bool = True
      whether or not to remap the tml.guid

    delete_unmapped_guids : bool = False
      if a match could not be found, set the FQN and object guid to None
    """
```

<b> &emsp; &emsp; usage</b>

```python
from thoughtspot_tml.utils import disambiguate
from thoughtspot_tml import Worksheet

# Load a Worksheet and check its data
ws = Worksheet.load("tests/data/DUMMY.worksheet.tml")
ws.guid == "2ea7add9-0ccb-4ac1-90bb-231794ebb377"     # => True
ws.worksheet.tables[0].name == "dim_retapp_products"  # => True
ws.worksheet.tables[0].fqn is None  # => True

# Assign a Table an FQN. This information can be retrieved from ThoughtSpot REST API metadata/list.
ws = disambiguate(ws, guid_mapping={"dim_retapp_products": "7fd39fdb-9dfe-4954-b5dd-9a5d846085b0"})
ws.worksheet.tables[0].fqn is None  # => False
ws.worksheet.tables[0].fqn == "7fd39fdb-9dfe-4954-b5dd-9a5d846085b0"  # => True

# Re-assign the GUID to a new environment.
ws = disambiguate(ws, guid_mapping={"7fd39fdb-9dfe-4954-b5dd-9a5d846085b0": "99999999-9999-4999-9999-999999999999"})
ws.worksheet.tables[0].fqn == "7fd39fdb-9dfe-4954-b5dd-9a5d846085b0"  # => True
ws.worksheet.tables[0].fqn == "99999999-9999-4999-9999-999999999999"  # => False

# Remove GUIDs which aren't found in the mapping, including the top-level GUID.
ws = disambiguate(ws, guid_mapping={}, delete_unmapped_guids=True)
ws.worksheet.tables[0].name == "dim_retapp_products"  # => True
ws.worksheet.tables[0].fqn is None  # => True
ws.guid is None   # => True
```

The `disambiguate` function will walk through the `thoughtspot_tml` TML object specifying the `.fqn` based on keys in the `guid_mapping` dictionary.

The `guid_mapping` will typically be a mapping of GUIDs between 2 environments, but the "before" environment can be any string. This can be helpful to quickly add `fqn` to any object which has yet to define it.

The `remap_object_guid` (__default__: `True`) will consider the top-level `TML.guid` as a candidate for re-mapping.

The `delete_unmapped_guids` (__default__: `False`) will remove any `.fqn`s which are not found in the `guid_mapping`.

## Migration to v2.0.0

With __V2.0.0__, we now programmatically build the TML spec from the underlying microservice's data structure. The largest benefit of this move is that we can now

### Round-tripping to File

The utility class `YAMLTML` has been replaced with `utils.determine_tml_type` and a private base class `TML`, which all public metadata objects inherit from. The TML type which is returned has the appropriate [de]serialization methods.

Both of the following patterns represent round-tripping.

```python
import pathlib

worksheet_fp = "tests/data/DUMMY.worksheet.tml"
worksheet_tml_str = pathlib.Path(worksheet_fp).read_text()

# V1.3.0
from thoughtspot_tml import YAMLTML

tml = YAMLTML.get_tml_object(worksheet_tml_str)
tml_document_str = YAMLTML.dump_tml_object(tml)


# V2.0.0
from thoughtspot_tml.utils import determine_tml_type
from thoughtspot_tml import Worksheet

tml_cls = determine_tml_type(path=worksheet_fp)
tml = tml_cls.loads(worksheet_tml_str)
# any one of these methods..
# tml = tml_cls.load(worksheet_fp)
# tml = Worksheet.loads(worksheet_tml_str)
# tml = Worksheet.load(worksheet_fp)
tml_document_str = tml.dumps(worksheet_fp)
```

### Identifying the TML Object Type

To identify the type of TML object you are working with in __V1.3.0__ you would use `.content_type`, with __V2.0.0__ you can now use `.tml_type_name`.

### GUID & FQN Handling

In __V1.3.0__, GUIDs were deleted from the underlying data structure with `.remove_guid()` in order to ensure the REST API created new objects. With __V2.0.0__, you simply set the `.guid` attribute (on the object itself) to `None`.

```python
# V1.3.0
tml = YAMLTML.get_tml_object(worksheet_tml_str)
tml.remove_guid()


# V2.0.0
tml = Worksheet.loads(worksheet_tml_str)
tml.guid = None
```

In __V1.3.0__, each TML object had their own methods for finding and replacing GUIDs. These took the form of `.remap_<object_type>_to_new_fqn()` and `.change_<object_type>_by_fqn()`, replacing `<object_type>` for the underlying data source which maps into the object you're operating on. These methods modify the underlying object.

In __V2.0.0__, we supply a single method to help add the `fqn` key to your TML document when referencing source tables or connections that share a name. [See disambiguation](#) for additional information.

For example, the below example shows adding the Table FQN references in a Worksheet.

```python
# V1.3.0
name_guid_map = {"Table 1": "0f814ce1-dba1-496a-b3de-38c4b9a288ed", "Table 2": "2e7a0676-2acf-4700-965c-efebf8c0b594"}
tml = YAMLTML.get_tml_object(worksheet_tml_str)
tml.remap_table_to_new_fqn(name_to_fqn_map=name_guid_map)
# - or -
tml.change_table_by_fqn(original_table_name="Table 1", new_table_guid="0f814ce1-dba1-496a-b3de-38c4b9a288ed")


# V2.0.0
from thoughtspot_tml.utils import disambiguate

tml = Worksheet.loads(worksheet_tml_str)
tml = disambiguate(tml, guid_mapping=name_guid_map)
```

## Notes on __ThoughtSpot Modeling Language__

- TML is implemented in the YAML 1.1 spec.
- When importing a TML file, if the `guid` matches to an existing object in the same Org being uploaded into, then that object will be updated. If the `guid` is missing or does not match an object in that Org, a new object is created with a new GUID. GUIDs are unique to the entire ThoughtSpot instance - if no GUID match is found in an Org, but the GUID has not been used on the instance, ThoughtSpot will use the GUID provided in the TML file when creating the new object.
