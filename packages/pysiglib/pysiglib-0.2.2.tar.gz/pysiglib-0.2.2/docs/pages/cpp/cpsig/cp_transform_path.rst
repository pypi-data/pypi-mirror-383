transform_path
================

The functions ``transform_path_float``, ``transform_path_double``, ``transform_path_int32`` and
``transform_path_int64`` apply path transformations to paths of input type ``float``, ``double``,
``int32`` and ``int64`` respectively. We provide documentation for ``transform_path_float``
and omit it for the remaining functions as they are identical beyond input type.

batch_transform_path
=======================

The functions ``batch_transform_path_float``, ``batch_transform_path_double``, ``batch_transform_path_int32`` and
``batch_transform_path_int64`` apply path transformations to batches of paths of input type ``float``, ``double``,
``int32`` and ``int64`` respectively. We provide documentation for ``batch_transform_path_float``
and omit it for the remaining functions as they are identical beyond input type.
