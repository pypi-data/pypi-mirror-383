              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

A pytest plugin that provides Terraform fixtures for testing AWS infrastructure with pytest.
This plugin enables you to write unit tests that verify the actual behavior of Terraform providers,
particularly the AWS provider, by creating and managing real AWS resources during test execution.

----

Overview
--------

This repository implements a pytest plugin with Terraform fixtures specifically designed
for pytest Terraform unit tests.
The Terraform tests allow you to verify actual behavior of Terraform providers, namely AWS, by:

* Creating real AWS infrastructure during tests
* Providing reusable fixtures for common AWS resources
* Managing resource lifecycle (creation and cleanup)
* Supporting multiple AWS regions and IAM roles
* Enabling integration testing of Terraform modules

Features
--------

* **AWS Client Fixtures**: Pre-configured boto3 clients for EC2, ELB, Route53, IAM, and more
* **Infrastructure Fixtures**: Ready-to-use fixtures for common AWS resources:

  * ``service_network`` - VPC with public/private subnets
  * ``instance_profile`` - IAM instance profile for EC2 instances  
  * ``jumphost`` - EC2 jumphost with proper networking
  * ``elasticsearch`` - Elasticsearch cluster setup
  * ``ses`` - Simple Email Service configuration
  * ``probe_role`` - IAM role with limited permissions
  * ``subzone`` - Route53 DNS subzone for testing

* **Terraform Integration**: Seamless integration with Terraform via ``terraform_apply`` context manager
* **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of AWS resources after tests (configurable)
* **Multi-Region Support**: Test across different AWS regions
* **IAM Role Support**: Assume roles for testing in different AWS accounts

Requirements
------------

* Python 3.10+
* pytest 8.3+
* Terraform installed and in PATH
* AWS credentials configured
* boto3 and botocore

Installation
------------

You can install "pytest-infrahouse" via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::

    $ pip install pytest-infrahouse

For development::

    $ pip install -e .

Usage
-----

Basic Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    def test_my_vpc(service_network, aws_region):
        """Test that creates a VPC and verifies its configuration."""
        vpc_id = service_network["vpc_id"]["value"]
        assert vpc_id.startswith("vpc-")

Using Custom Terraform Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    from pytest_infrahouse import terraform_apply

    def test_custom_infrastructure(aws_region, test_role_arn, request):
        module_path = "path/to/terraform/module"
        
        # Write terraform.tfvars
        with open(f"{module_path}/terraform.tfvars", "w") as fp:
            fp.write(f'region = "{aws_region}"\n')
            if test_role_arn:
                fp.write(f'role_arn = "{test_role_arn}"\n')
        
        # Apply Terraform and test
        with terraform_apply(module_path, destroy_after=True) as tf_output:
            assert tf_output["resource_name"]["value"] == "expected_value"

Command Line Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The plugin adds several command-line options::

    pytest --test-zone-name example.com          # Set DNS zone for tests
    pytest --aws-region us-west-2               # Set AWS region
    pytest --test-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123:role/test-role  # Set IAM role
    pytest --keep-after                         # Don't destroy resources after tests

Available Fixtures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**AWS Client Fixtures:**

* ``boto3_session`` - Configured boto3 session
* ``ec2_client`` - EC2 client
* ``route53_client`` - Route53 client  
* ``elbv2_client`` - ELBv2 client
* ``iam_client`` - IAM client
* ``autoscaling_client`` - Auto Scaling client

**Infrastructure Fixtures:**

* ``service_network`` - VPC with public/private subnets, internet gateway
* ``instance_profile`` - IAM instance profile for EC2
* ``jumphost`` - EC2 jumphost in the service network
