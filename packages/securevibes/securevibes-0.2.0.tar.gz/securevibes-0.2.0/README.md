# üõ°Ô∏è SecureVibes

**AI-Native Security System for Vibecoded Applications**

SecureVibes uses **Claude's multi-agent architecture** to autonomously find security vulnerabilities in your codebase. Four specialized AI agents work together to deliver comprehensive, context-aware security analysis with concrete evidence.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install for the latest release on PyPi (might not have all the latest changes in the code)
pip install securevibes

# NOTE: the package uploaded on PyPi might not have all the latest changes. 
# I will try to release a new version of the package whenever there are significant changes/developments
# If you would rather use the version with the latest changes, you can do the following:

# Install for the latest version (might be buggy)
git clone https://github.com/anshumanbh/securevibes.git
cd securevibes
virtualenv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install -e packages/core

# Authenticate (choose one method)
# Method 1: Session-based (recommended)
# You could use your Claude subscription here, if you don't want to pay per API requests
claude  # Run interactive CLI, then type: /login

# Method 2: API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Scan your project
securevibes scan /path/to/code --streaming --debug
```

## ü§ñ Multi-Agent Architecture

SecureVibes orchestrates 4 specialized Claude agents:

1. **Assessment Agent** - Maps codebase architecture and technology stack
2. **Threat Modeling Agent** - Applies STRIDE methodology for realistic threats
3. **Code Review Agent** - Uses security thinking framework to find vulnerabilities
4. **Report Generator** - Compiles findings into actionable reports

**Key Difference:** Unlike traditional pattern-matching tools, SecureVibes agents *understand* your code's context, architecture, and business logic to find novel vulnerabilities that static analysis misses.

## üéØ Common Use Cases

```bash
# Default: creates .securevibes/scan_report.md (markdown format)
securevibes scan .

# Real-time progress for large repos (recommended)
securevibes scan . --streaming

# Export JSON for CI/CD pipeline
securevibes scan . --format json --output security-report.json

# Custom markdown report (saved to .securevibes/custom_report.md)
securevibes scan . --format markdown --output custom_report.md

# Terminal table output (no file saved)
securevibes scan . --format table

# Focus on critical/high severity
securevibes scan . --severity high

# Fast scan with cheaper model
securevibes scan . --model haiku

# Quiet mode for automation
securevibes scan . --quiet
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Control agent models and analysis depth via environment variables:

```bash
# Authenticate first (see Quick Start above)
# Then optionally customize:

# Customize agent models (default: sonnet)
export SECUREVIBES_CODE_REVIEW_MODEL="opus"  # Max accuracy
export SECUREVIBES_THREAT_MODELING_MODEL="sonnet"

# Control analysis depth (default: 50)
export SECUREVIBES_MAX_TURNS=75  # Deeper analysis
```

**Models:** `haiku` (fast/cheap) | `sonnet` (balanced) | `opus` (thorough/expensive)

## üêç Python API

```python
import asyncio
from securevibes import Scanner

async def main():
    # Authentication is automatically handled by Claude Agent SDK via:
    # - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable, or
    # - Session token from `claude` CLI (run: claude, then /login)
    scanner = Scanner(
        model="sonnet",  # Use shorthand: sonnet, haiku, opus
        debug=True  # Show agent narration for verbose output
    )
    
    result = await scanner.scan("/path/to/repo")
    print(f"Found {len(result.issues)} vulnerabilities")
    print(f"Cost: ${result.total_cost_usd:.4f}")

asyncio.run(main())
```
