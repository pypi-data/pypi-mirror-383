# Scope Rules

- As an agent, ONLY add the code that is explicitly required
- Do not add any code that is not explicitly asked for
- You can ask for permission to add code that is not explicitly requested
- Keep implementations minimal and focused
- Avoid adding unnecessary imports or dependencies
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- If unsure about adding something, ask for clarification first
- Prioritize clarity and simplicity over cleverness
