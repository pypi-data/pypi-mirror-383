## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-10

### Added
- **Automatic Dependency Installation** - New `--auto-setup` / `-a` flag to automatically install agent dependencies
  - Supports `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, and `setup.py`

  - Documentation & learning (tutorial, example agents, videos)
  - Integrations (VS Code, Web UI, API server, Slack/Discord)
  - Quality of life (better errors, keyboard shortcuts, tab completion, conversation management)
  - Advanced features (multi-agent, RAG, persistent memory, marketplace)
  - Developer experience (debug mode, config wizard, scaffolding, hot reload)
  - Testing & quality (integration tests, fuzzing, performance benchmarks)
  - Community & sharing (plugin system, templates, import/export)
  - Security & safety (sandboxing, audit logging, secret detection)

### Changed
- Minor version bump to reflect new auto-setup feature

## [0.1.3] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- **Eliminated Import Error Messages During Startup**
  - Completely removed "No module named" errors when using fully qualified agent paths
  - Parent package `__init__.py` files are no longer executed during agent loading
  - Register parent packages as stub modules (sufficient for Python's import machinery)
  - Added sys.stderr suppression during agent module execution as defense-in-depth
  - Fixes issue with paths like `/agents/local/timmy/agent.py` where parent `agents/__init__.py` tries to import sibling modules

### Impact
- Clean startup experience with no confusing error messages
- Agent functionality unchanged (absolute imports still work)
- All 161 tests passing

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- **Configuration System Bugs** - Fixed three critical config bugs
  - Fixed config loading precedence (explicit path now has highest priority)
  - Fixed NoneType handling in config merge (skips None values from YAML)
  - Fixed default template to use `agents: {}` instead of `agents:`
  - Resolves "NoneType not iterable" errors
- **Enhanced Relative Import Support** - Improved multi-module imports
  - Added proper parent package registration in sys.modules
  - Agents can now import from multiple sibling modules
  - Fixed: `from .utils import X` followed by `from .helpers import Y`

### Testing
- All 161 tests passing (up from 160)
- Added test for multiple sibling imports
- All 24 config tests now pass (was 20/24)

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- **Relative Import Support** - Agents with relative imports (from .module or from ..module) now work correctly on all platforms
  - Added package root detection by walking up directory tree for __init__.py files
  - Set proper __package__ attribute for Python import system
  - Support for both same-level and parent-level relative imports
  - Added comprehensive tests for relative import scenarios

### Added
- Comprehensive documentation updates:
  - PyPI, tests, and coverage badges in README
  - Complete INSTALL.md rewrite with platform-specific instructions
  - New TROUBLESHOOTING.md with common issues and solutions
  - Auto-setup documentation for .chatrc and ~/.prompts/

### Testing
- Added 2 new tests for relative imports (156 total tests passing)
- Verified Windows installation and compatibility

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-09

### Added
- **Agent Alias System** - Save agents as short names for quick access
- **Command History** - Navigate previous queries with ↑↓ arrows (persisted to `~/.chat_history`)
- **Multi-line Input** - Type `\\` to enter multi-line mode for code blocks
- **Token Tracking** - Track tokens and costs per query and session
- **Prompt Templates** - Reusable prompts from `~/.prompts/` with variable substitution
- **Configuration System** - YAML-based config with per-agent overrides
- **Status Bar** - Real-time metrics (queries, tokens, duration)
- **Session Summary** - Full statistics displayed on exit
- **Rich Formatting** - Enhanced markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
- **Error Recovery** - Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Agent Metadata Display** - Show model, tools, and capabilities
- **Async Streaming Support** - Real-time response display with streaming
- **Cross-Platform Installers** - Support for macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Comprehensive Test Suite** - 158 tests with 61% code coverage
- **Type Hints** - Full type annotations throughout codebase

### Fixed
- Logging configuration no longer interferes with other libraries
- Cost display duplication removed (was showing same value twice)
- Error messages sanitized to prevent path information leakage
- Magic numbers extracted to named constants for maintainability
- All linting issues resolved (ruff, black, mypy)

### Changed
- Renamed from "AWS Strands Chat Loop" to "Basic Agent Chat Loop" (framework-agnostic)
- Made `anthropic-bedrock` an optional dependency (moved to `[bedrock]` extra)
- Added `python-dotenv` as core dependency
- Improved error handling with more informative messages

### Security
- Error messages now show only filenames, not full system paths
- Environment variable loading limited to 3 parent directories
- Log files created with secure behavior
