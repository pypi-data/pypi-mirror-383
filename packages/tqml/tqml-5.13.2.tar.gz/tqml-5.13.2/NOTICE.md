Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

should be resolved in favor of the then-current license agreement.


IMPORTANT NOTICE – PLEASE READ AND AGREE BEFORE USING NVIDIA SOFTWARE OFFERINGS.
This NVIDIA Software License Agreement is entered into between the entity you represent,
or, if you do not designate an entity, you individually (“Customer”), and NVIDIA Corporation
(“NVIDIA”) and governs the use of the Software Offerings. This NVIDIA Software License Agreement
consists of the terms and conditions below and all documents attached to or referenced in this
NVIDIA Software License Agreement (together, the “Agreement”). Key terms are defined in Section 17.
Customer and NVIDIA are each a “party” and collectively the “parties.”

By registering to use or using the Software Offerings, Customer is affirming that it has read the
Agreement and agrees to its terms. If Customer does not have the required authority to enter into
the Agreement or if it does not accept all Agreement terms and conditions, Customer should not
register to use or use the Software Offerings.

LICENSE

- Grant. Subject to the terms of the Agreement, Customer’s Order Form and license parameters of an
Enterprise Product Part Number, and payment of applicable fees, NVIDIA grants Customer a limited,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as expressly granted in the Agreement)
license during the Term to install, use and reproduce the Software.

Limited Grants. The grants in Section 1.1 above are further limited as follows:

- Users that receive an Enterprise Product identified as “not for resale” or “NFR”
(typically a license to a distributor or reseller) may exercise the grants in Section 1.1
solely for internal evaluation or to demonstrate the Enterprise Product to others, but may
not use, distribute or deploy in production.

- Users that receive an Enterprise Product for trial may exercise the grants in Section 1.1
solely for the trial period.

Authorized Users.
Under the Agreement, Customer Personnel may access and use the Software Offerings
and Persons may access and use Customer Products. As between NVIDIA and Customer, Customer is
responsiblefor supporting the use of Customer Products. Customer is responsible for the
compliance with the terms of the Agreement. Any act or omission that if committed by Customer
would constitute a breach of the Agreement will be deemed to constitute a breach of the Agreement
if committed by Customer’s Authorized Users.

License Types.
The terms in this Section 1.4 apply only to Enterprise Products, not to Community Products.
The license types below describe features that may be part of an Enterprise Product; and not
all license types may be available for each Enterprise Product. Enterprise Products are licensed
under the following license types: Subscription per CPU Socket, Subscription per GPU, Subscription
per Node, Subscription per CCU, Subscription per HCA, Usage Based Subscription, or Perpetual license.
Once Customer transitions from a Community Product to an Enterprise Product version under a paid
Subscription or Perpetual license, any Customer use of such Enterprise Product must be under a paid
Subscription or Perpetual license. Customer’s order, license key or the product description will
indicate the parameters of Customer’s license.

Replacement Products.

NVIDIA may, from time to time at its discretion, give Customer the option to replace a certain
Enterprise Product, subject to payment of applicable fees. In such cases, Customer must discontinue
use of the replaced Enterprise Product timely upon the start of use of the replacement Enterprise Product.
If requested in writing by NVIDIA, Customer will provide a written certificate signed by an authorized
officer affirming Customer’s compliance with the replacement terms.

Promotional Offerings.
NVIDIA may, from time to time, offer free or discounted pricing programs covering certain uses of Software
Offerings, for example having different license parameters or fees for evaluation or academic use. NVIDIA
may stop accepting new sign-ups or discontinue a promotional offering at any time. Standard charges will
apply after a promotional offering ends or if Customer exceeds the promotional offering use terms.
Customer must comply with any additional terms, restrictions, or limitations (e.g., limitations on the
total amount of usage) for a promotional offering as described in the corresponding offer terms.

AI ETHICS.
Use of the Software Offerings under the Agreement must be consistent with NVIDIA’s Trustworthy AI terms at
https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/agreements/trustworthy-ai/terms/.

PRE-RELEASE VERSIONS AND FEATURES.
NVIDIA will clearly designate Software versions that are in Pre-Release. Pre-Release versions may not
be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security,
privacy, accessibility, availability, and reliability standards relative to commercially provided NVIDIA
software, materials and services. Use of a Pre-Release version may result in unexpected results, such as
loss of use or loss of content. Customer may use a Pre-Release version at Customer’s risk, understanding
that such versions are not intended for use in business-critical systems and Customer may stop at Customer’s
convenience. NVIDIA may choose to abandon development and terminate the availability of a Pre-Release version
at any time without liability. Pre-release versions are provided “AS-IS,” “WITH ALL FAULTS,” and “AS-AVAILABLE,”
and are excluded from Enterprise Support.

SERVICES.

General Service Terms.
Unless otherwise indicated by NVIDIA in this Agreement or an Order Form, Software Subscriptions include Enterprise
Support, Maintenance and Updates. Enterprise Support, Maintenance and Updates may be sold separately for Perpetual
licenses. After the expiration of Services, Customer retains the right to use a Perpetual license at the
last-supported level subject to the terms of the Agreement. Unless NVIDIA accepts Customer’s request for Enterprise
Support, Maintenance and Updates in an Order Form, NVIDIA is under no obligation to provide any Service. Unless
Software is provided with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of the applicable Software Offering
and governed by the Agreement.

Use of Maintenance and Updates.
NVIDIA encourages users to use Maintenance and Updates available to them. Customer’s choice not to deploy Maintenance
or Update as they become available may result in issues with operability, compatibility and interoperability and result
in the Software in use being non-conforming to later Software documentation.

Maintaining the Authorized Number of Licenses.
Customer’s use of Maintenance or Update does not change the number of authorized licenses. Customer agrees to promptly
discontinue use of prior versions as necessary to maintain the authorized number of licenses.

Work Out of Scope.
Any enhancements or additions to Software beyond Maintenance or Updates are outside of the scope of this Agreement.
Services for NFR,
Trial or Developer Program Licenses. NVIDIA is not obligated to provide Services for any free NFR, trial or
developer program items, even if identified as Subscription versions, and any Services are provided at NVIDIA’s discretion.

USERNAME AND PASSWORD.
Customer is responsible for securely maintaining log-in information for Customer Authorized Users’ use, and for all
activities under Customer’s account(s). Customer agrees to notify NVIDIA at enterprisesupport@nvidia.com immediately of
any known or suspected security incidents or unauthorized use of Customer’s account(s) or the Software Offering.

COMPONENTS UNDER OTHER LICENSES.

Component Licenses. The Software may include or be distributed with Separate Components.
The Separate Components are subject to the applicable OSS Licenses or other license terms, including any proprietary
notices, disclaimers, requirements and extended use rights; except that the Agreement will prevail regarding the use
of third-party open source software, unless NVIDIA components are provided under an OSS License or a third-party OSS
License requires its license terms to prevail.

No License Provided.
Customer acknowledges and agrees that it is Customer’s sole responsibility to obtain any additional third-party licenses
required to make, have made, use, have used, sell, import, and offer for sale Customer’s products or services that include
or incorporate any Separate Components, including, without limitation, audio and/or video encoders and decoders and
implementations of technical standards. NVIDIA does not grant to Customer under the Agreement any necessary patent or other
rights, including standard essential patent rights, with respect to any Separate Components.

PAYMENT TERMS AND TAXES.

Ordering. Customer may be able to purchase a Subscription or Perpetual license directly from NVIDIA, or via a reseller (in
some cases a cloud marketplace reseller), as available. Each Order Form will be effective when entered into by the Customer
and NVIDIA. Each order placed by Customer through an Order Form is a separate transaction of the parties under the Agreement.

Fees. When purchasing directly from NVIDIA, the following terms apply: Fees for the Subscriptions or Perpetual licenses are set
forth in the associated Order Form and are payable pursuant to the terms of such Order Form. Unless otherwise expressly indicated
in an Order Form, fees will be invoiced upon Customer’s purchase, are payable upon invoice and are expressed in U.S. Dollars.
Each Order Form placed are non-cancelable and fees received are non-refundable. All amounts not paid when due will accrue interest
(without the requirement of a notice) at the lower of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permissible by law until the unpaid amounts
are paid in full. Fees do not include any taxes, duties or similar charges.

Taxes.
If NVIDIA is required to pay sales, use, property, value-added or other taxes based on the payments provided under the Agreement and
if NVIDIA is required to collect and remit such taxes, then such taxes will be billed to and paid by Customer or Customer’s reseller,
unless NVIDIA receives a valid exemption or resale certificate. If Customer is not billed the applicable tax under the Order Form, then
it is Customer’s responsibility to properly remit the tax directly to the applicable tax jurisdiction. Further, Customer acknowledges
that the payments to NVIDIA under the Agreement will be made in full without reduction for withholding taxes, if applicable.
This section will not apply to taxes based on NVIDIA’s net income or payroll taxes.

Overdue Payment.
If any payment is overdue from Customer or a reseller, NVIDIA reserves the right to suspend or terminate Subscriptions or Perpetual licenses,
in addition to any other remedies it may have, until the payment delinquency is corrected. Payment obligations survive any expiration or
termination of the Agreement.

Price Changes.
Any price change will only apply to purchases after the price change.

LIMITATIONS.

The following limitations and restrictions apply to the Software, Derivative Samples and Derivative Models, and Customer is responsible for the
consequences of non-conformance with these limitations:

- Customer will use the Software exclusively for authorized purposes, consistent with the Agreement’s terms and all applicable laws, regulations
and the rights of others.

- The Software, Derivative Samples and Derivative Models may run on any computing system, except that NVIDIA proprietary software governed by this
Agreement (such as drivers, CUDA and TensorRT software) is licensed only to run on NVIDIA Platforms. For clarity, NVIDIA proprietary software may be
present on systems without NVIDIA GPUs, if not running on such systems.

- Customer may not combine the use of paid and unpaid Software, Derivative Samples and Derivative Models in a way that avoids incurring fees or exceeding
use limits or quotas.

Customer may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble Software components provided in binary form, nor attempt in any other manner to obtain source
code of such Software components.

Except as expressly granted in the Agreement or Product-Specific Terms, Customer may not copy, sell, resell, rent, sublicense, transfer, assign, timeshare,
distribute, modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the Software, including, without limitation, in any publicly accessible software repositories.
Unless Customer is an authorized distributor or reseller or is otherwise authorized under this Agreement, Customer may not distribute or sublicense the Software
on a stand-alone basis.

Customer may not indicate that a product or service developed with the Software is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA unless expressly authorized in writing by
NVIDIA.

Customer may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any technical limitation, encryption, security, digital rights management or authentication mechanism contained
in the Software.

Customer may not use the Software in any manner that would cause components to become subject to an OSS License or other shareware license.

Customer may not distribute or disclose to third parties the results of benchmarking, competitive analysis, regression or performance data relating to the Software
without the prior written permission from NVIDIA.

Customer may not replace any NVIDIA software components in the Software that are governed by the Agreement with other software that implements NVIDIA application
programming interfaces (APIs).

Customer may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of the output generated using the NVIDIA proprietary software for the purpose of translating
such output artifacts to target a non-NVIDIA Platform.

Customer may not use the Software for the purpose of developing competing products or technologies or assisting a third party in such activities.

Customer acknowledges that the Software as delivered under the Agreement is not tested or certified by NVIDIA for use in any Critical Application. Beyond NVIDIA
delivering the Software in accordance with the Agreement, NVIDIA will not be liable to Customer or any third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or damages
arising from such uses. Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that systems and applications developed or deployed with the Software include sufficient safety
and redundancy features and comply with all applicable legal and regulatory standards and requirements.

Customer may not use the Software to infringe any third party’s Intellectual Property Rights.

Customer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its Affiliates, and their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors,
from and against any and all third-party claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and expenses (including but not
limited to attorney’s fees and costs incident to establishing the right of indemnification) arising out of or related to (i) products or services developed or deployed
with or that use the Software (including results or data generated from such use), or claims that such products or services violate laws, or infringe, violate, or
misappropriate any third party right, provided that Customer is not obligated to provide intellectual property indemnification to NVIDIA for Software that Customer has
not modified; or (ii) a violation of the terms and conditions of the Agreement. If Customer is prohibited by law from entering into the indemnification obligation above,
then Customer assumes, to the extent permitted by law, all liability for all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees, costs
 and expert witnesses’ fees) that are the stated subject matter of the indemnification obligation above.

CONFIDENTIALITY.

Right to Use Confidential Information. The receiving party may use the disclosing party’s Confidential Information only to exercise its rights and perform its obligations
under the Agreement. The receiving party may disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information to its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, contractors,
independent external auditors, and advisors (including legal and accounting) who have a need to know that information in their work for the receiving party under the
Agreement and who are bound to protect that information under obligations of confidentiality at least as restrictive as those described in the Agreement. The
receiving party will not disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information to any third party, except as expressly authorized in the Agreement,
without first having written approval of the disclosing party. The receiving party will protect the Confidential Information of the disclosing party with at least
the same degree of care that the receiving party uses to protect its own similar confidential and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care.
Irrespective of any expiration or termination of the Agreement, the receiving party’s duty to protect the disclosing party’s Confidential Information expires five (5)
years after the date Confidential Information was disclosed. If the disclosing party sends a written request, the receiving party will promptly return or destroy all
Confidential Information received from the disclosing party, together with copies, except that a party may retain archival copies in accordance with its document retention
policy or as required by law.

Exceptions. Confidential Information does not and will not include information that: (i) was in the public domain at the time it was communicated to the receiving party
by the disclosing party, or later entered the public domain other than by a breach of the Agreement by the receiving party, (ii) is or was rightfully received or known
by the receiving party without restriction on disclosure or any obligation of confidentiality, (iii) is or was independently developed by or for the receiving party without
using any of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, or (iv) is or was generally made available by the disclosing party without restriction on disclosure. The
receiving party will not be liable for disclosure of Confidential Information required to be disclosed in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body of
competent jurisdiction. The receiving party will (unless restricted) provide the disclosing party with prior written notice of the required disclosure to permit the disclosing
party to seek confidential treatment of such information and disclose only the information necessary to comply with the requirements.

TERMINATION.

Automatic License Termination. For Enterprise Products NVIDIA designates as Perpetual or Subscription based, Customer license terminates automatically without notice from NVIDIA
at the earlier of the expiration or termination of the applicable license or the Agreement (“Term”). Either party may terminate licenses for Community Products for convenience
with thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party

Early Termination of the Agreement.
NVIDIA may at any time with advance written notice terminate the Agreement or an Order Form (i) if use of a Software, Derivative Sample or Derivative Model materially breaches the
terms of the Agreement, or violates the rights of others, or violates applicable laws and regulations, (ii) if Customer commences or participates in any legal proceeding against
NVIDIA with respect to the Software, or NVIDIA intellectual property embodied in the Derivative Samples or Derivative Models, or (iii) as needed, in NVIDIA’s reasonable judgment,
to comply with laws and regulations. Customer may terminate at any time the Agreement or an Order Form if NVIDIA does not timely cure a material breach of the Agreement. If the
termination basis is breach and the breach is curable, the other party will have thirty (30) days from the date of notification to cure the breach, or five (5) days to cure if the
breach is of a payment obligation.

Effects of Termination.
Upon any expiration or termination of the Agreement or an Order Form, any fees owed to NVIDIA become immediately due and payable even if longer terms have been agreed earlier.
NVIDIA or an NVIDIA reseller will also bill Customer for any outstanding payment obligations related to a Subscription or Perpetual license period in the event of early termination
for any reason other than for NVIDIA’s uncured material breach. Customer agrees to promptly discontinue use of the affected Software and any NVIDIA intellectual property contained
in the Derivative Samples and Derivative Models, and destroy all copies in Customer’s possession or control (including any licenses in use by Customer’s Authorized Users).
Upon written request, Customer will certify in writing that Customer has complied with Customer’s commitments under this section.

Services Termination.
Services end (i) at the earlier of the expiration or termination of a Software Subscription, and (ii) upon termination of a Perpetual license, and in either case no credit or refund
 will be provided.

Survival.
Sections 7 through 17 of this Agreement will survive termination.

OWNERSHIP, ATTRIBUTION AND FEEDBACK.

NVIDIA Ownership.
The Software Offerings, including all Intellectual Property Rights, are and will remain the sole and exclusive property of NVIDIA or its licensors. Except as expressly granted in the Agreement,
(i) NVIDIA reserves all rights, interests and remedies in connection with the Software Offerings, and (ii) no other license or right is granted to Customer by implication, estoppel or otherwise.

Customer Ownership.
Subject to the rights of NVIDIA and its suppliers in Software Offerings, Customer holds all rights, title and interest in and to Customer’s services, applications, Derivative Samples and Derivative

Attribution.
Customer may not change or remove copyright or other proprietary notices in the Software or misrepresent the authorship of the Software, and Customer must cause any modified files to carry prominent
notices stating that Customer changed the files such that modifications are not misrepresented as an original Software. Except as necessary to give attribution to works as described in this section,
Customer is not granted any trademark license under the Agreement.

Feedback.
Customer may, but is not obligated to, provide Feedback to NVIDIA or an NVIDIA Affiliate. Feedback, even if designated as confidential by Customer, will not create any confidentiality obligation for
NVIDIA or its Affiliates beyond not identifying Customer as the source of the Feedback. If Customer provides Feedback, Customer hereby grants NVIDIA, its Affiliates and its designees a non-exclusive,
perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, and transferable license, under Customer’s Intellectual Property Rights, to publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce,
use, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, distribute (through multiple tiers of distribution), import, create derivative works of, and otherwise commercialize and exploit the Feedback for any purpose
at NVIDIA’s discretion. NVIDIA agrees that Customer Feedback is provided “as-is” without a warranty of any kind.

(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, AND EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A PARTY’S REMEDIES FAIL THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

Damages Capped.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NVIDIA’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS OR CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED
THE NET AMOUNT PAID FOR CUSTOMER’S USE UNDER AN ACTIVE SUBSCRIPTION LICENSE FOR THE PARTICULAR SOFTWARE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PERIOD PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE
LIABILITY (OR UP TO US$100.00 IF CUSTOMER OBTAINED SUCH SOFTWARE AT NO CHARGE).

GOVERNING LAW.
The Agreement will be governed in all respects by the laws of the United States and the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of laws principles or the United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods. The state and federal courts residing in Santa Clara County, California will have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute or claim arising out of or related to the Agreement,

GENERAL.

Assignment.
NVIDIA may assign, delegate or transfer its rights or obligations under the Agreement by any means or operation of law. Customer agrees that Customer will not transfer or assign the Agreement or Customer’s rights
and obligations by any means or operation of law without NVIDIA’s permission. Any attempted assignment not approved by NVIDIA in a signed writing will be void and of no effect.

Subcontracting.
NVIDIA may subcontract obligations under the Agreement but will remain liable to Customer for any subcontracted obligations.

Notices.
If NVIDIA needs to contact Customer about a Software Offering, Customer consents to receive notices electronically. Customer is responsible for keeping Customer’s notification email current. The parties agree that
electronic notice will satisfy any legal communication requirements, and that email notices will be treated as received when the email is sent. Customer is required to send legal notices to NVIDIA Corporation,
2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California 95051, United States of America, Attention: Legal Department, with an emailed copy to legalnotices@nvidia.com.

Government Rights.

The Software, including its documentation and technology (“Protected Items”), are “Commercial products” as this term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer
software documentation” as such terms are used in, respectively, 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202 & 252.227-7014(a)(1). Before any Protected Items are supplied to the U.S. Government, Customer will (i) inform
the U.S. Government in writing that the Protected Items are and must be treated as commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation developed at private expense; (ii) inform the U.S. Government
that the Protected Items are provided subject to the terms of the Agreement; and (iii) mark the Protected Items as commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation developed at private expense.
In no event will Customer permit the U.S. Government to acquire rights in Protected Items beyond those specified in 48 C.F.R. 52.227-19(b)(1)-(2) or 252.227-7013(c) except as expressly approved by NVIDIA in writing.

Force Majeure.
Except for payment of fees or taxes, neither party will be liable during an instance of Force Majeure.

Audit.
During the term of the Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, Customer will maintain complete and accurate information regarding Customer’s activities under the Agreement and NVIDIA or an independent
auditor will have the right to audit Customer during regular business hours to validate and confirm Customer’s information and compliance with the terms of the Agreement. Audits will be conducted no more frequently than
annually, unless non-compliance was previously found. If an audit reveals an underpayment, Customer will promptly remit the full amount of such underpayment to NVIDIA including interest that will accrue (without the
requirement of a notice) at the lower of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permissible by law. If the underpaid amount exceeds five percent (5%) of the amounts payable to NVIDIA during the audited period or if the audit
reveals a material non-conformance with the terms of the Agreement, then Customer will reimburse NVIDIA’s reasonable audit costs. Further, Customer agrees that the party transacting to sell Software Offerings to Customer
may share with NVIDIA information regarding Customer’s compliance with the Agreement.

Entire Agreement.
Regarding the subject matter of the Agreement, the parties agree that the Agreement constitutes the entire and exclusive agreement between the parties regarding the Software Offerings and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous
communications. Any additional or different terms or conditions, whether contained in purchase orders, order acknowledgments, invoices or otherwise, will not be binding and are null and void.

Severability.
If any provision of the Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Agreement, which will remain in full
force and effect.

No Waiver.
No waiver of any term of the Agreement will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and NVIDIA’s failure to assert any right or provision under the Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such
right or provision.

Independent Contractors.
The parties are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, joint employment, agency or other form of business association between the parties or their respective employees, or
authorize either party to make or enter into any commitments for or on behalf of the other party. Neither party will have the power to bind the other party or incur any obligation on its behalf without the other party’s prior
written consent. Neither party, or their respective employees, is entitled to receive or make a claim for any benefits that the other party or its Affiliates may make available to its respective employees, such as health insurance,
retirement plan contributions, equity awards or sick or vacation pay.

Independent Development.
Nothing in the Agreement will be construed to limit or restrict either party from independently developing, providing, or acquiring any materials, services, products or technology that are similar to the subject of the Agreement,
provided that the party does not breach its obligations under the Agreement in doing so.

Order of Precedence.
If there is a conflict between the documents that make up the Agreement, the documents will control in the following order (starting with the highest order of precedence): (a) the NVIDIA privacy policy, (b) the remainder of the
Agreement (excluding the privacy policy and Product Specific Terms), (c) the Product Specific Terms, (d) the Enterprise Support Policy, and (e) the Order Form.
