class EventGateway:
    """
    Gateway for processing events and also an event bus for storing the events pending delivery to agents.

    In OpenAgents, several entities can send out events: 1/ Agents, 2/ Mods, 3/ System (which is the network core).

    General event flow for inbound events:
    - Events arrive from transport layer
    - System events are processed immediately by SystemCommandProcessor
    - Regular events go through EventProcessorPipeline
    - Responses are returned to the transport layer

    Event routing:

        Each event in general has an event name, a source and a destination.

        Example event names:
        - agent.message
        - project.run.completed
        - channel.message.posted
        - mod.generic.message_received
        - system.register_agent

        Example source IDs:
        - agent:charlie_123
        - mod:openagents.mods.communication.simple_messaging
        - system:system

        Example destination IDs:
        - agent:charlie_123
        - mod:openagents.mods.communication.simple_messaging
        - system:system
        - channel:general
        - agent:broadcast

        If the the destination is an agent ID, then the event will be delivered to the target agent directly. If the destination is system, then the event will
        be discarded after processing. Each event will be processed by mods in the network, and each mod can decide whether to process the message or not.
        A special case is if the destination is a specific mod, then the event will only be processed by that mod.

    Channel events and broadcast events:

        When an event has a `channel` destination, it will be delivered and visible to all member agents in the channel.
        When an event has a `agent:broadcast` destination, it will be delivered and visible to all agents in the network.

    Subscription of events:

        By default, an agent will be notified of all events it's permitted to see. However, an agent can subscribe to
        specific events with event name patterns. Once subscribed, only the events that match the subscription will be
        delivered to the agent.

    Delivery of events:

    - After processed by the event processor, there are two outcomes:
        1. The event is captured by the system or a mod in the process, and an event response is returned.
        2. None of the system or mods capture the event, and None is returned from the processor.

    - In the first case, the event response will be immediately returned to sender of the event and no message delivery will happen.
      Therefore, if a mod wants to intercept the event, it just needs to return an event response.
    - In the seconds case, the event will be delivered to the destination specified in the event.
    - Delivery to agents:
        - If the event has a `channel:...` destination, it will be delivered to all member agents in the channel.
        - If the event has a `agent:broadcast` destination, it will be delivered to all agents in the network.
        - If the event has a `agent:...` destination, it will be delivered to the target agent directly.
        - Otherwise, the event will be discarded.

    The event gateway maintains a queue for each agent to temporarily store delivered events. An event notifier will monitor
    the queue and deliver the events to the agent. In some cases, the agent can also poll the queue to get new events.

    Key responsibilities of the event gateway:
    1. Route events to appropriate processors (system commands vs regular events)
    2. Maintain event subscriptions for agents
    3. Queue events for delivery to agents
    4. Prevent duplicate event processing
    5. Coordinate with the event processor pipeline

    The event gateway will replace the old event bus (EventBus).
