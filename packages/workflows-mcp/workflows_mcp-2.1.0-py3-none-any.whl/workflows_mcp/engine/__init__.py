"""Workflow engine core components.

This package contains the core workflow execution engine components adapted from the legacy
workflow system. Key components:

- Result: Type-safe Result monad for error handling
- DAGResolver: Dependency resolution via Kahn's algorithm (synchronous)
- WorkflowBlock: Async base class for workflow blocks
- BlockInput/BlockOutput: Pydantic v2 base classes for validation
- BLOCK_REGISTRY: Global registry for workflow block types
- WorkflowExecutor: Async workflow executor
- WorkflowDefinition: Workflow definition container
- WorkflowRegistry: Central registry for managing loaded workflow definitions
- WorkflowSchema: Pydantic v2 schema for YAML workflow validation
