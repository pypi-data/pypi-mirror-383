# The Configuration file and the Register

Let's delve a little bit more into Biom3d structure. 

Biom3d code is modular, which means that it is easy to plug in or out so-called *modules*. The complete list of existing modules can be found in [biom3d.register](https://github.com/GuillaumeMougeot/biom3d/blob/main/src/biom3d/register.py). 



## Training configuration file definition

All of the hyper-parameters are defined in the configuration file. The configuration files are stored in Python format in the `configs` folder. You can create a new config file by copy/paste one of the existing ones and by adapting the parameters defined below. For instance, copy/paste and rename `unet_pancreas.py` in the same folder and open this Python script with your favourite text editor. 

There are two types of hyper-parameters in the configuration file: builder parameters and modules parameters. 

### Builder parameters

Builder parameters are written as follows: `NAME=value`. The dataset builder parameters must be adapted to your own dataset and the Auto-config builder parameters value can be set with the pre-processing values. The rest of the builder parameters is optional. 

Here is the exhaustive list of builder parameters:

```python
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Dataset builder-parameters
# EDIT THE FOLLOWING PARAMATERS WITH YOUR OWN DATASETS PARAMETERS

# Folder where pre-processed images are stored
IMG_DIR = 'data/pancreas/tif_imagesTr_small'

# Folder where pre-processed masks are stored
MSK_DIR = 'data/pancreas/tif_labelsTr_small'

# (optional) path to the .csv file storing "filename,hold_out,fold", where:
# "filename" is the image name,
# "hold_out" is either 0 (training image) or 1 (testing image),
# "fold" (non-negative integer) indicates the k-th fold, 
# by default fold 0 of the training image (hold_out=0) is the validation set.
CSV_DIR = 'data/pancreas/folds_pancreas.csv'

# CSV_DIR can be set to None, in which case the validation set will be
# automatically chosen from the training set (20% of the training images/masks)
# CSV_DIR = None 

# model name
DESC = 'unet_mine-pancreas_21'

# number of classes of objects
# the background does not count, so the minimum is 1 (the max is 255)
NUM_CLASSES=2

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Auto-config builder-parameters
# PASTE AUTO-CONFIG RESULTS HERE

# batch size
BATCH_SIZE = 2

# patch size passed to the model
PATCH_SIZE = [40,224,224]

# larger patch size used prior rotation augmentation to avoid "empty" corners.
AUG_PATCH_SIZE = [48,263,263]

# number of pooling done in the UNet
NUM_POOLS = [3,5,5]

# median spacing is used only during prediction to normalize the output images
# it is commented here because we did not noticed any improvemet
# MEDIAN_SPACING=[0.79492199, 0.79492199, 2.5]
MEDIAN_SPACING=[]

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Advanced paramaters (can be left as such) 
# training configs

# whether to store also the best model 
SAVE_BEST = True 

# number of epochs
# the number of epochs can be reduced for small training set (e.g. a set of 10 images/masks of 128x128x64)
NB_EPOCHS = 1000

# optimizer paramaters
LR_START = 1e-2 # comment if need to reload learning rate after training interruption
WEIGHT_DECAY = 3e-5

# whether to use deep-supervision loss:
# a loss is placed at each stage of the UNet model
USE_DEEP_SUPERVISION = False

# whether to use softmax loss instead of sigmoid
# should not be set to True if object classes are overlapping in the masks
USE_SOFTMAX=False 

# training loop parameters
USE_FP16 = True
NUM_WORKERS = 4

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# callback setup (can be left as such) 
# callbacks are routines that execute periodically during the training loop

# folder where the training logs will be stored, including:
# - model .pth files (state_dict)
# - image snapshots of model training (only if USE_IMAGE_CLBK is True)
# - logs with this configuration stored in .yaml format and tensorboard logs
LOG_DIR = 'logs/'

SAVE_MODEL_EVERY_EPOCH = 1
USE_IMAGE_CLBK = True
VAL_EVERY_EPOCH = SAVE_MODEL_EVERY_EPOCH
SAVE_IMAGE_EVERY_EPOCH = SAVE_MODEL_EVERY_EPOCH
USE_FG_CLBK = True
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

### Module parameters

The modules parameters are written as follows in the configuration file:

```python
NAME=Dict(
  fct="RegisterName"
  kwargs=Dict(
    key_word=arguments,
  )
)
```

The `fct` argumentation correspond to one of the module name listed in the `register.py` file. The `register.py` file lists all existing modules in Biom3d. To have more details about one specific module, we recommended to read the documentation of the module. There are currently 5 main modules type: dataset, model, metric, trainer and predictor. Each modules are not compatible with all modules, read the documentation for more details.

## Training

Please create a folder named `logs/` in the current directory. 

Once the configuration file is defined, the training can start with the following command:

```
python biom3d/train.py --config configs.your_config_file
```

Careful, do not put `.py` in the end of your config file name. 

A new sub-folder, that we dubbed base-folder in this documentation, will be created in the `logs/` folder. The base-folder contains 3 sub-folders:
* `image`: with the snapshots of the current training results
* `log`: with the configuration files stored in Yaml format and with Tensorboard event file
* `model`: with the Pytorch model(s). 

You can plot the training curves during model training with the following command:

```
tensorboard --logdir=logs/
```

### Advanced training/evaluation/prediction

Biom3d has originally been designed to fasten state-of-the-art tools development for 3d bio-medical imaging, that's why it possible to run in a single command: the training, the test prediction and the test metrics computations. Use `python biom3d/train.py --help` to get more details.

## Prediction

Once your model is trained, it is ready to use for prediction with the following command:

``` 
python biom3d/pred.py --log path/to/base-folder --dir_in path/to/raw/data --dir_out path/of/the/future/predictions 
```

For Omero user, you can use the following command to download a Omero Dataset or a Omero Project and to directly run the prediction over this dataset:

```
python biom3d/omero_pred.py --obj Dataset:ID
```

or with a Omero Project

```
python biom3d/omero_pred.py --obj Project:ID
```

The previous command will ask you to provide your omero server name, your omero identification and your omero password. 

### Advanced prediction

`pred.py` can also be used to compare the prediction results with existing test annotations. Use `python biom3d/pred.py --help` for more details.
