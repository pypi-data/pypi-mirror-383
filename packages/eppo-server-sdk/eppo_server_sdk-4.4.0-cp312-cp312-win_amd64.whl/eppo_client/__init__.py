# Rust currently does not define submodules as packages, so Rust
# submodules are not importable from Python.[1] There is a hacky way
# to make submodules re-exportable (by tweaking sys.modules) but it
# has some drawbacks.
#
# It's more straightforward to add a bit of Python to re-export items
# at different locations.
#
# This __init__.py just re-exports everything from the Rust module.[2]
