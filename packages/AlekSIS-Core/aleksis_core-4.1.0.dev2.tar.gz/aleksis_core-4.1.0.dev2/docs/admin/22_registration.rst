Registration and user invitations
=================================

In addition to central management of user accounts, AlekSIS allows self-registration
by users. Registration can be either fully open, or based on personal invitations.

In a system handling critical data, access control should be as tight as possible.
However, there are scenarios where central account creation is not feasible, e.g.
for optional guardian accounts. In such a scenario, the invitation system allows
for processes like handing out invitation codes as a letter or through e-mail
campaigns.

Configuration
-------------

.. _core-registration:

Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Registration can be enabled via the configuration interface (``Administration â†’ Configuration``) in the frontend.

In the ``Authentication`` tab, click the checkbox ``Enable signup`` to enable
signup for everyone. A menu item will be added for public registration.

.. warning::
   Do not enable this feature unless you intend to run a public AlekSIS instance.

Before enabling registration, you should consider restricting allowed usernames.
By default, all ASCII characters are allowed in usernames. Often, it is advisable
to not allow special characters. This often depends on the systems that will be
linked to AlekSIS.

To restrict usernames to a certain format, a regular expression can be defined
in the ``Regular expression for allowed usernames`` preference. For example, to
restrict the username to lower case letters and numbers, and beginning with a number,
the regex can be set to ``^[a-z][a-z0-9]+$`.

User invitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _core-user-invitations:

In the same location as public registration, the invitation system can be enabled.

* Authentication

  * Enable invitations: Click to enable invitations.
  * Length of invite code: Length of invitation code packets, defaults to 5.
  * Size of packets: Configure how many packets are generated, defaults to 3.

By default, an invitation code looks like the following:
``abcde-abcde-abcde``.

A menu item will become available for users to enter their invitation code.

Usage
-----

Invite existing person
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To invite an existing person, open the person in AlekSIS and click the ``Invite
user`` menu item.

The invitation will be sent to the person's email address, and can only
be used by this person. Upon registration, the new account will automatically
be linked to the existing person.
