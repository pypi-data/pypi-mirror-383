==============

An ECS is a computing server consisting of CPUs, memory, images, and Elastic Volume Service (EVS) disks that allow on-demand allocation and elastic scaling. ECSs integrate virtual private cloud (VPC), virtual firewalls, and multi-data-copy capabilities to create an efficient, reliable, and secure computing environment. This ensures stable and uninterrupted operation of services.
