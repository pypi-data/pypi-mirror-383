## Transfusion - Pytorch

Pytorch implementation of [Transfusion](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.11039), "Predict the Next Token and Diffuse Images with One Multi-Modal Model", from MetaAI.

In this repo, we will substitute diffusion with flow matching given the success of Flux from Black Forest Labs (but will keep the original paper title given Transflow does not have the same ring). This repository will also attempt to extend to any number of modalities.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install transfusion-pytorch
```

## Usage

One modality, say images

```python
from torch import randint, randn
from transfusion_pytorch import Transfusion

model = Transfusion(
    num_text_tokens = 256,
    dim_latent = 384,
    modality_default_shape = (4,),  # fallback, in the case the language model did not produce a valid modality shape
    transformer = dict(
        dim = 512,
        depth = 8
    )
)

# any torch.long is text, torch.float is modalities

text_and_images = [
    [randint(0, 256, (16,)), randn(4, 384), randint(0, 256, (8,)), randn(6, 384)],
    [randint(0, 256, (16,)), randn(7, 384), randint(0, 256, (5,)), randn(2, 384), randint(0, 256, (9,))]
]

loss = model(text_and_images)

loss.backward()

# after much training

one_multimodal_sample = model.sample()
```

Multiple different modalities

```python
from torch import randint, randn
from transfusion_pytorch import Transfusion

model = Transfusion(
    num_text_tokens = 256,
    dim_latent = (384, 192),                 # specify multiple latent dimensions
    modality_default_shape = ((4,), (2,)),   # default shapes for first and second modality
    transformer = dict(
        dim = 512,
        depth = 8
    )
)

# then for the Tensors of type float, you can pass a tuple[int, Tensor] and specify the modality index in the first position

# any torch.long is text, torch.float is modalities

text_images_and_audio = [
    [randint(0, 256, (16,)), (0, randn(4, 384)), randint(0, 256, (8,)), (1, randn(6, 192))],
    [randint(0, 256, (16,)), randn(7, 384), randint(0, 256, (5,)), (1, randn(2, 192)), randint(0, 256, (9,))]
]

loss = model(text_images_and_audio)

loss.backward()

# after much training

one_multimodal_sample = model.sample()
```

Automatically taking care of encoding and decoding of images

```python
import torch
from torch import nn, randint, randn
from transfusion_pytorch import Transfusion, print_modality_sample

mock_encoder = nn.Conv2d(3, 384, 3, padding = 1)
mock_decoder = nn.Conv2d(384, 3, 3, padding = 1)

model = Transfusion(
    num_text_tokens = 12,
    dim_latent = 384,
    channel_first_latent = True,
    modality_default_shape = (4, 4),
    modality_encoder = mock_encoder,
    modality_decoder = mock_decoder,
    transformer = dict(
        dim = 512,
        depth = 8
    )
)

text_and_images = [
    [
        randint(0, 12, (16,)),  # 16 text tokens
        randn(3, 8, 8),         # (8 x 8) 3 channeled image
        randint(0, 12, (8,)),   # 8 text tokens
        randn(3, 7, 7)          # (7 x 7) 3 channeled image
    ],
    [
        randint(0, 12, (16,)),  # 16 text tokens
        randn(3, 8, 5),         # (8 x 5) 3 channeled image
        randint(0, 12, (5,)),   # 5 text tokens
        randn(3, 2, 16),        # (2 x 16) 3 channeled image
        randint(0, 12, (9,))    # 9 text tokens
    ]
]

loss = model(text_and_images)

loss.backward()

# after much training

one_multimodal_sample = model.sample()

print_modality_sample(one_multimodal_sample)
```

To pretrain on language first, just pass in your text as type `Int['batch seq']`

```python
import torch
from transfusion_pytorch import Transfusion

model = Transfusion(
    num_text_tokens = 256,
    dim_latent = 384,
    transformer = dict(
        dim = 512,
        depth = 8,
    )
).cuda()

text = torch.randint(0, 256, (2, 1024)).cuda()

loss = model(text)
loss.backward()

# after much training

sampled = model.generate_text_only(text[:, :1], 1024)
```

## Examples

To run any of the examples `train_{example_name}.py` in the project root, simply install dependencies first as so

```bash
$ pip install .[examples]
```

If you run into some weird error with `safetensors`, run this too

```bash
$ pip install -U diffusers transformers accelerate scipy ftfy safetensors
```
