# Monarch Integration Examples (Experimental)

These examples use internal integration APIs. They demonstrate compute
allocation and exploratory integration behavior; actor functionality is not
yet implemented.

Moved from `examples/05_monarch_integration/` for clarity.

Examples:
- `basic_allocation.py`: Allocate compute and show current limitations
- `basic_monarch_flow.py`: Create meshes via backend; health checks
- `distributed_training.py`: Mocked actor-style orchestration over Flow

Notes:
- Not for production use; APIs and behavior are subject to change.
- Requires `MITHRIL_API_KEY` and project configuration; see docs.
