"""
AI Training Observability Dashboard System
=========================================

Enterprise-grade observability platform for AI/ML training infrastructure.
Provides comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and visualization for distributed
training systems with focus on performance, reliability, and cost optimization.

Key Features:
- Real-time system health monitoring across clusters
- Distributed training infrastructure observability
- Multi-dimensional performance metrics visualization
- Service dependency mapping and tracing
- Predictive failure detection and alerting
- Cost attribution and optimization insights
- Security and compliance monitoring
- Automated incident response workflows

Usage:
    >>> import finopsmetrics as vc
    >>> from finopsmetrics.observability import ObservabilityDashboard
    >>>
    >>> # Initialize observability platform
    >>> obs = ObservabilityDashboard()
    >>> obs.monitor_cluster('gpu-cluster-1', nodes=64)
    >>> obs.track_service('training-service', replicas=8)
    >>> obs.show_real_time_dashboard()
