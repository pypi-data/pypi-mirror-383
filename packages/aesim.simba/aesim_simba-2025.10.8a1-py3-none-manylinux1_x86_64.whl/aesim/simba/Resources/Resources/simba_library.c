 * ----------------------------
 *	With the predictive time-step solver, the simulation time does not elapses linearly.
 *	The C Code model needs to support time-travel and a snapshot mechanism is implemented. 
 *	The predictive time-step solver uses it to restore a model to a previous state when needed.
