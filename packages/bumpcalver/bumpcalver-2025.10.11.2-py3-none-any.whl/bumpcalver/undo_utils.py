"""
Undo utilities for BumpCalver.

This module provides functionality to undo version bump operations by restoring
files from backups and optionally undoing git operations.

Functions:
    undo_last_operation: Undo the most recent version bump operation.
    undo_operation_by_id: Undo a specific operation by its ID.
    restore_files_from_backups: Restore files from their backup copies.
    undo_git_operations: Undo git commits and tags.

Example:
    success = undo_last_operation()
    if success:
        print("Successfully undid last version bump")
