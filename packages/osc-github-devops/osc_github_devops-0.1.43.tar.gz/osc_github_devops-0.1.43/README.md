## Composite actions and reusable workflows for Python projects

### OS-Climate and FINOS are both Linux Foundation projects

- [https://os-climate.org/](https://os-climate.org/)
- [https://www.finos.org/](https://www.finos.org/)
- [https://www.linuxfoundation.org/](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)

### Description

This repository contains shared GitHub composite actions and workflows.

The purpose of these is to provide small modular components and larger pieces
 of shared DevOps functionality which may be helpful to the OS-Climate
community, and indeed other open-source projects. Right now, the current focus is
on Python and the tooling around Python projects, since that is the language
used for most of OS-Climate projects and repositories.

### Python Template Code

The repository also contains a sample/template Python project, published to the
Python package index and is installable with the Python "pip" command. The
sample code acts as a test be to ensure Python packages will build, test and
publish using the supplied GitHub composite actions and workflows.
