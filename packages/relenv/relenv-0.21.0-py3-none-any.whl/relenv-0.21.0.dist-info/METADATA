Relenv
======

Relenv creates re-producable and re-locatable python builds. The builds
created with Relenv are re-producable in the sense that all binaries for the
builds are built from source. These builds are re-locatable meaning you can
move the root directory around on the filesystem; and even different machines
of same architecture.

Relenv can be thought of in a similar way to projects like virtualenv and
pyenv. The difference between Relenv and these projects is that each relenv
contains the entire python interpereter. Relenv environments can be moved
around and shared with others.
