With CMK-26121 the build package job was split into pre-build, build and sign. This change sets the overall `trigger-cmk-distro-package` as job instead of the `trigger-cmk-distro-package` which would allocate resources longer due to the waittime for the pre-build part. Additionally the package would not be signed.\n\n[1.4.2]: https://review.lan.tribe29.com/gitweb?p=checkmk_dev_tools.git;a=tag;h=refs/tags//1.4.2\n", "meta": {"type": "bugfix", "scope": ["all"], "affected": ["all"]}}, "releases": {"1.4.2": [{"upload_time": "2025-10-14T08:35:51"}], "1.4.1": [{"upload_time": "2025-09-24T13:15:08"}], "1.4.0": [{"upload_time": "2025-09-24T13:15:08"}], "1.3.0": [{"upload_time": "2025-09-24T13:13:47"}], "1.2.1": [{"upload_time": "2025-09-09T08:19:44"}], "1.2.0": [{"upload_time": "2025-08-26T17:37:14"}], "1.1.1": [{"upload_time": "2025-08-25T11:58:43"}], "1.1.0": [{"upload_time": "2025-08-18T18:46:19"}], "1.0.0": [{"upload_time": "2025-08-18T14:43:43"}], "0.4.1": [{"upload_time": "2025-08-18T12:36:24"}], "0.4.0": [{"upload_time": "2025-08-18T08:21:29"}], "0.3.0": [{"upload_time": "2025-08-14T08:52:11"}], "0.2.5": [{"upload_time": "2025-08-11T10:21:04"}], "0.2.4": [{"upload_time": "2025-08-05T15:08:29"}], "0.2.3": [{"upload_time": "2025-08-04T15:42:43"}], "0.2.2": [{"upload_time": "2025-08-04T15:42:37"}], "0.2.1": [{"upload_time": "2025-07-31T14:24:35"}], "0.2.0": [{"upload_time": "2025-07-31T12:58:49"}], "0.1.0": [{"upload_time": "2025-07-15T10:40:06"}], "0.0.0": [{"upload_time": "2025-07-14"}]}}
