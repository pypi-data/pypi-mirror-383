v1.3.0
======

*(2025-10-12)*


Bug fixes
---------

- The bundled libssh 0.11.2 no longer fails, when the SFTP server announces
  protocol version 3, but does not provide error message and language tag
  in the ``SSH_FXP_STATUS`` message -- by :user:`Jakuje`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`222`.

- Fixed reading files over SFTP that go over the pre-defined chunk size.

  Prior to this change, the files could end up being corrupted, ending up with the last read chunk written to the file instead of the entire payload.

  -- by :user:`Jakuje`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`638`.

- Repetitive calls to ``exec_channel()`` no longer crash and return reliable output -- by :user:`Jakuje`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`658`.

- Uploading large files over SCP no longer fails -- by :user:`Jakuje`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`661`.

- Improved performance of SFTP transfers by using larger transfer chunks -- by :user:`Jakuje`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`664`.

- Fixed crash when more operations were called after ``session.close()`` -- by :user:`Jakuje`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`709`.


Features
--------

- The underlying ``SSH_OPTIONS_KEY_EXCHANGE`` option of ``libssh`` is
  now available as ``key_exchange_algorithms`` -- by :user:`NilashishC`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`675`.

- Added a ``pylibsshext.session.connect()`` parameter
  ``open_session_retries`` -- by :user:`justin-stephenson`.

  The ``open_session_retries`` session ``connect()``
  parameter allows a configurable number of retries if
  libssh ``ssh_channel_open_session()`` returns ``SSH_AGAIN``.
  The default option value is 0, no retries will be
  attempted.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`756`.

- Added a ``pylibsshext.session.connect()`` parameter
  ``timeout_usec`` to set ``SSH_OPTIONS_TIMEOUT_USEC``.

  This allows setting the ``SSH_OPTIONS_TIMEOUT_USEC``
  ssh option, though ``SSH_OPTIONS_TIMEOUT`` is a more
  practical option.

  -- by :user:`justin-stephenson`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`756`.


Deprecations (removal in next major release)
--------------------------------------------

- The project stopped being tested under Ubuntu 20.04 VM since

Removals and backward incompatible breaking changes
---------------------------------------------------

- Dropped support for Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8
  -- by :user:`Qalthos` and :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`532`, :issue:`718`.

  have to update their version of pip to pick up the new ones.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`562`.


Improved documentation
----------------------

- Added a :ref:`Communication <communication>` section to the main
  documentation page -- by :user:`Andersson007`.

  :issue:`640`.

- Fixed the argument order in the ``scp.put()`` usage example
  -- by :user:`kucharskim`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`646`.


Packaging updates and notes for downstreams
-------------------------------------------

- PyPI now only ships :pep:`600`-compatible manylinux wheels
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`562`.

- The ``pytest-forked`` dependency of build, development and test environments was removed -- by :user:`Jakuje`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`658`, :issue:`760`.

- The wheels are now built in cached container images with a
  correctly set platform identifier.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`692`.

- The ``manylinux`` build scripts now limit ``cmake`` below
  version 4 -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`713`.

- Stopped skipping SCP tests in the RPM spec -- by :user:`Jakuje`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`714`.

  wheels published on PyPI -- by :user:`Jakuje`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`753`.

- The RPM spec file no longer makes use of unpackaged dists
  from PyPI on RHEL. The configuration is almost identical to
  the one for Fedora. Only the ``setuptools-scm`` spec is
  temporarily patched to allow older versions under RHEL.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`759`.

- A workaround has been applied to the in-tree build backend that prevents
  Cython from hanging when ``libssh`` header files are missing
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  The patch makes ``cythonize()`` single-threaded because :mod:`multiprocessing`
  gets stuck. The upstream will eventually fix this by migrating to
  :mod:`concurrent.futures`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`762`, :issue:`769`, :issue:`770`.

- Updated the bundled version of libssh to 0.11.3 in platform-specific
  wheels published on PyPI -- by :user:`Jakuje`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`766`.


Contributor-facing changes
--------------------------

- The manylinux build scripts have been adjusted to resolve the
  dependency conflict between certain ``packaging`` and ``setuptools``
  versions -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  Previously, this was making some of the CI jobs crash with a traceback
  when building said wheels.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`1dfbf70fdfd99ae75068fdb3630790c96101a96a`.

- The Git archives are now immutable per the packaging recommendations.
  This allows downstreams safely use GitHub archive URLs when
  re-packaging -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`ea34887831a0c6547b32cd8c6a035bb77b91e771`.

  Instead, this is delegated to the ``cibuildwheel`` tool.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`562`.

- Updated the version of ``libssh`` to the latest release v0.11.1
  in the cached ``manylinux`` build environment container images
  -- by :user:`Jakuje`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`636`.

- All the uses of ``actions/upload-artifact@v3`` and
  ``actions/download-artifact@v3`` have been updated to use
  ``v4``. This also includes bumping
  ``re-actors/checkout-python-sdist`` to ``release/v2`` as it
  uses ``actions/download-artifact`` internally.

  -- by :user:`NilashishC` and :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`676`.

- The ``dumb-pypi``-produced static package index now renders correct
  URLs to the distribution packages -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`678`, :issue:`679`, :issue:`749`.

- The CI is now configured to use
  :external+tox:std:ref:`tox-run---installpkg` when testing
  pre-built dists. This replaces the previously existing
  tox-level hacks in ``test-binary-dists`` and
  ``test-source-dists`` environments that have now been
  removed.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`688`.

- The wheel building workflows have been updated to set the
  OCI image platform identifiers to legal values like
  ``linux/arm64``.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`692`.

- The CI is now configured to always set job timeout values.
  This will ensure that the jobs that get stuck don't consume
  all 6 hours just hanging, improving responsiveness and the
  overall CI/CD resource usage.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`706`.

- The linting is now configured to check schemas of the
  Read The Docs configuration file and the GitHub Actions
  CI/CD workflow files in addition to enforcing timeouts.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`707`.

- The ``multiarch/qemu-user-static`` image got replaced with
  ``tonistiigi/binfmt`` because the latter is no longer
  maintained and the former includes the fixed version of QEMU.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`713`.

- Added Fedora 41 and 42 to CI configuration -- by :user:`Jakuje`.

  for building wheel targeting ``manylinux1``, ``manylinux2010`` and
  ``manylinux2014`` tags.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`730`.

- The host OS is now ARM-based when building ``manylinux_*_*_aarch64``
  images for CI/CD -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`731`.

- False negative warnings reported by ``coveragepy`` when are now
  disabled. They are evident when ``pytest-cov`` runs with the
  ``pytest-xdist`` integration. ``pytest`` 8.4 gives them more
  visibility and out ``filterwarnings = error`` setting was turning
  them into errors before this change.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`732`.

- GitHub Actions CI/CD no longer runs jobs that install source
  distributions into the tox environments for testing
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  This is a temporary workaround for an upstream bug in tox and
  said jobs are non-essential.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`733`.

- Updated the pre-built ``libffi`` version to 3.4.8 in the
  cached ``manylinux`` build environment container images
  -- by :user:`Jakuje`.

  with ``libssh`` and ``openssl`` pre-built -- by :user:`Jakuje` and
  :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`740`.

- Started caching ``manylinux`` build images to be used for producing ``2_34`` tagged wheels
  in ``build-manylinux-container-images`` workflow -- by :user:`KB-perByte`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`741`.

- The :file:`reusable-cibuildwheel.yml` workflow has been refactored to
  be more generic and :file:`ci-cd.yml` now holds all the configuration
  toggles -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`750`.

- Updated the version of ``libssh`` to the latest release v0.11.2
  in the cached ``manylinux`` build environment container images
  -- by :user:`Jakuje`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`752`.

  to the ``cibuildwheel`` invocation -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`754`.

- Fixed link to python3-pytest for CentOS 9 Stream as it was recently moved from
  CRB to AppStream -- by :user:`Jakuje`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`758`.

- The CI/CD jobs for smoke-testing RPMs have been simplified
  and now, they execute the same steps for all distro types.
  They make use of ``pyproject-rpm-macros`` even under RHEL.
  Installing external RPMs is the only conditional step that
  is skipped on Fedora.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`759`.

- The ``requires`` setting has been removed from :file:`tox.ini`, which
  works around the upstream tool bug. This enabled us to re-introduce
  CI jobs testing against sdist under Python 3.12 and newer
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`764`.

- Updated the version of ``libssh`` to the latest release v0.11.3
  in the cached ``manylinux`` build environment container images

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`9053c1008bb169c8e362a92782d46c7c0d3b1c06`, :commit:`aaa12159b5cdda763a83dcf4ee920510cad83463`.

  description has been simplify to stop attempting to make
  URLs to arbitrary GitHub addresses -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`f4ad1b76`.

- The in-tree :pep:`517` build backend's regular expression
  has been hotfixed to replace the "project" substitution

  :commit:`627f718d`.


----


v1.2.0
======

*(2024-06-07)*


Bug fixes
---------

- |project| no longer crashes when received EOF or when channel is not explicitly
  closed -- by :user:`pbrezina`.

  Previously, |project| crashed if ``channel.recv`` was called and ``libssh``
  returned ``SSH_EOF`` error. It also crashed on some special occasions where
  channel was not explicitly closed and the session object was garbage-collected
  first.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`576`.


Features
--------

- Started exposing the ``SSH_OPTIONS_PUBLICKEY_ACCEPTED_TYPES``
  and ``SSH_OPTIONS_HOSTKEYS`` options publicly
  -- by :user:`Qalthos`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`527`.

- The ``request_exec()`` method was added to the ``Channel`` class. It exposes an
  interface for calling the respective low-level C-API of the underlying
  ``libssh`` library -- by :user:`pbrezina`.

  Additionally, the following calls to ``libssh`` are now available in the same
  class: ``request_exec()``, ``send_eof()``, ``request_send_signal()`` and
  ``is_eof`` which is exposed as a :py:class:`property`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`576`.


Improved documentation
----------------------

- Fixed spelling of "Connect" in the ``Session.connect()``
  docstring -- by :user:`donnerhacke`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`474`.

- Added a tip to the :ref:`installation guide <Installing |project|>`
  on how to set compiler flags when installing from source
  -- :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`499`.

- Fixed the example of invoking remote commands by using
  ``Channel.exec_command()`` in snippets -- by :user:`pbrezina`.

  Its previously showcased version wasn't functional.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`576`.


Packaging updates and notes for downstreams
-------------------------------------------

- A flaw in the logic for copying the project directory into a
  temporary folder that led to infinite recursion when :envvar:`TMPDIR`
  was set to a project subdirectory path. This was happening in Fedora
  and its downstream due to the use of `pyproject-rpm-macros
  <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pyproject-rpm-macros>`__. It was
  only reproducible with ``pip wheel`` and was not affecting the
  ``pyproject-build`` users.

  -- by :user:`hroncok` and :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`89c9b3a`.

- From now on, the published distribution package artifacts
  for the new releases are signed via `Sigstore
  <https://sigstore.dev>`__ -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  This is happening as a part of the GitHub Actions CI/CD
  workflow automation and the signatures are uploaded to
  the corresponding GitHub Release pages.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`986988a`.

- The platform-specific macOS wheels are now built using the
  Python interpreter from https://python.org. They are tagged
  with ``macosx_10_9`` -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`333`.

- The ``toml`` build time dependency has been replaced with
  ``tomli`` -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  The ``tomli`` distribution is only pulled in under Python
  versions below 3.11. On 3.11 and higher, the standard
  library module :py:mod:`tomllib` is now used instead.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`501`.

- Started using the built-in ``setuptools-scm`` Git archive
  support under Python 3.7 and higher -- :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`502`.

- Added support for Python 3.12 -- by :user:`Qalthos`.

  It is now both tested in the CI and is advertised through
  the Trove classifiers.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`532`.

- The ``Cython`` build time dependency now has the minimum
  version of 3.0 under Python 3.12 and higher
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  The previous versions of ``Cython`` are still able to build
  the project under older Python versions.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`540`.

- :pep:`660` is now enabled -- :user:`webknjaz`.

  Previously, due to restrictive :pep:`517` hook reimports,
  our in-tree build backend was losing :pep:`non-PEP 517 <517>`
  hooks implemented in newer versions of ``setuptools`` but not
  the earlier ones. This is now addressed by reexporting
  everything that ``setuptools`` exposes with a wildcard.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`541`.

- The ``setuptools-scm`` build dependency CI pin was updated to 8.1.0 —
  this version fixes a date parsing incompatibility introduced by Git 2.45.0
  (:gh:`pypa/setuptools_scm#1038 <pypa/setuptools_scm/issues/1038>`,
  :gh:`pypa/setuptools_scm#1039 <pypa/setuptools_scm/pull/1039>`)
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`601`.

  code coverage -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`538`.

- Added separate changelog fragment types for contributor-
  and downstream-facing patches -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  Their corresponding identifiers are ``contrib`` and ``packaging``
  respectively. They are meant to be used for more accurate
  classification, where one would resort to using ``misc`` otherwise.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`539`.

- :pep:`660` is now enabled -- :user:`webknjaz`.

  This effectively means that the ecosystem-native editable
  install mode started working properly.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`541`.

- The duplicated jobs matrices for building manylinux wheels
  now reside in a single GitHub Actions CI/CD reusable
  workflow definition.

  :gh:`pypa/setuptools_scm#1038 <pypa/setuptools_scm/pull/1039>`)
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`601`.

- The CI/CD configuration was fixed to allow publishing
  to PyPI and other targets disregarding the test stage
  outcome. This used to be a bug in the workflow definition
  that has now been fixed.
