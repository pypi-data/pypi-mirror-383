## Framework structure
The component diagram of the developed framework is shown beow:
![](/images/2.png)

The framework consists of the following methods and functions:
1. A package of multilevel knowledge graph synthesis programs, which includes: 

1.1. Inductive synthesis method of multilevel KG

5. A Python package for evaluating and comparing knowledge graphs wich also contains a set of SPARQL request is built based on model structure and is aimed to test different request types. 


## How to use

Below the main steps that should be executed to evaluate the performance of inductive and deductive synthesis algorithms on the example of building five-levels knowledge graph are enumerated: 
1. Install the Python library kg4cdo:

	**pip install kg4cdo**

2. Generate private graph models. 

To obtain a multilevel knowledge graph, the one of the functions **create_uni_model** or **create_cust_model** should be used. 

	Examples:
	
	create_uni_model(5,50,"exponential", 2, 3, "1-2")
	
	create_cust_model(Levels,100000,"exponential", Models, 5, "1-2;2-3;3-4;4-5;5-6;6-7;7-8;8-9;9-10")

To obtain a multilevel knowledge graph only for a one selected level, the one of the functions **create_uni_model_for_One_level** or **create_cust_model_for_One_level** should be used.

	Examples:
	
	create_uni_model_for_One_level(10, 100000, "exponential", 5, 5, "1-2;2-3;3-4;4-5", 1)
	
	create_cust_model_for_One_level(Levels, 100000, "exponential", Models, 5, "1-2;2-3;3-4;4-5", 1)

To obtain a multilevel knowledge graph for a list of selected levels, the one of the functions **create_uni_model_for_List_levels** or **create_cust_model_for_List_levels** should be used.

	Examples:
	
	create_uni_model_for_List_levels(5, 50, "exponential", 1, 5, "1-2;2-3;3-4;4-5;5-6;6-7;7-8;8-9;9-10", "9;10")
	
	create_cust_model_for_List_levels(Levels, 100000, "exponential", Models, 5, "1-2;2-3;3-4;4-5;5-6;6-7;7-8;8-9;9-10", "9;10")

3. Perform inductive synthesis and estimate its execution time. 

To perform inductive synthesis it is required to use the function  **inductive_synthesis**

	Example:
	
	inductive_synthesis("TMP/Test_model.csv", "TMP/Links_rules.csv", "TMP/Test_model.csv", "Hierarchy_model/", "C:/Blazegraph/Load", "http://127.0.0.1/")

4. Perform deductive synthesis and estimate its execution time (for basic and modified algorithms). To perform deductive synthesis, it is nesseccary to use the functions **deductive_synthesis** and **deductive_synthesis_modified**.

	Examples:
	
	deductive_synthesis('Req.csv', 'TMP/Test_facts1.csv', 5)
	
	deductive_synthesis_modified('Req.csv', 'TMP/Test_facts1.csv')

5. Analyze the execution time of SPARQL queries to CSDO models.
In order to analyze the execution time of SPARQL queries to the CSDO models in the form of a knowledge graph with different parameters, it is necessary to generate such models using the generators: 

5.1. **createRDF_universal** or **createRDF_domain**. 

	Examples:
	
	createRDF_universal("KG_data", 6,100,"exponential", 3, 3, "1-2;2-3", "C:/Blazegraph/Load", "Hierarchy_model/", "http://127.0.0.1/ont_test#",False, '2025-08-01', '2025-08-02', '2-10;3-10;4-10')
	
	createRDF_domain("KG_data", Levels, 100000, "exponential", Models, 5, "1-2;2-3;3-4;4-5;5-6;6-7;7-8;8-9;9-10", "C:/Blazegraph/Load", "Hierarchy_model/", "http://127.0.0.1/ont_test#",False, '2025-08-01', '2025-08-02', '2-10;3-10;4-10')

5.2. **createRDF_universal_One_level**.

	Example:
	
	createRDF_universal_One_level("KG_data", 5, 10, "1-2;2-3;3-4;4-5", "C:/Blazegraph/Load", "Linear_model/", "http://127.0.0.1/ont_test#", isDynamic=True, start_date='2025-09-10', end_date='2025-09-18', value_min=0, value_max=100, elements_number_dynamic=100)

## Experiments

### Synthesis of Multilevel knowledge graphs: Methods and technologies for dynamic networks

In this [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197623004281) we present a real two [realistic datasets](https://zenodo.org/records/7605504) (namely, for SPARQL querying performance analysis, and for our case study on dynamic network monitoring). Our experiments show that the developed models of multilevel synthesis reduce the time complexity up to 73% on practice compared to the baselines, and are lossless and able to beat their competitors based on parallel knowledge graph processing from 4% to 91% in terms of computational time (depending on the query type). Further parallelisation of our multilevel models is even more efficient (the reduction of query processing time is about 40%–45%) and opens promising prospects for the creation and exploitation of dynamic Knowledge Graphs in practice.
