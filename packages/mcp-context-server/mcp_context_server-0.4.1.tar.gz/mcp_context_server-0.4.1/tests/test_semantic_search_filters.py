"""
Regression tests for semantic search filter bug.

Tests the fix for the bug where semantic_search_tool returns fewer results
than requested when thread_id or source filters are applied.

Root cause: sqlite-vec's k parameter in MATCH clause limits results at
virtual table level BEFORE JOIN and WHERE filters are applied.

Solution: CTE-based pre-filtering with vec_distance_l2() scalar function.
