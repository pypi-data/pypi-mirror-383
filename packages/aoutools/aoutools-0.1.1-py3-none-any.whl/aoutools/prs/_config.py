    """
    A configuration class for Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) calculation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    chunk_size : int, default 20000
        The number of variants to include in each processing chunk.
    samples_to_keep : Union[hl.Table, Sequence[str], Sequence[int], str, int], optional
        A collection of sample IDs to keep. Accepts a Hail Table, or a Python
        list, set, tuple of strings or integers, or a single string or integer.
        If None, all samples are retained.
    weight_col_name : str, default 'weight'
        The column name in weights table that contains effect sizes or weights.
    log_transform_weight : bool, default False
        If True, applies a natural log transformation to the weight column.
        Useful when weights are odds ratios (OR), since PRS assumes additive
        effects on the log-odds scale.
    include_n_matched : bool, default False
        If True, adds a column 'n_matched' with the number of variants matched
        between weights table and VDS. This option has a performance cost and
        should be used only when necessary.
    sample_id_col : str, default 'person_id'
        The column name to use for sample IDs in the final output table.
    split_multi : bool, default True
        If True, splits multi-allelic variants in VDS into bi-allelic variants
        prior to calculation.
    ref_is_effect_allele : bool, default False
        If True, assumes effect allele in weights file corresponds to reference
        allele in VDS. Used only when `split_multi` is True.
    strict_allele_match : bool, default True
        Used only when `split_multi` is False. If True, enforces that one
        allele in weights table matches reference allele in VDS and other
        allele is a valid alternate. If False, only effect allele is checked to
        correspond to either reference or alternate allele, and other allele is
        not verified.
    detailed_timings : bool, default False
        If True, logs timing information for each major step. Helpful for
        diagnosing performance issues.
