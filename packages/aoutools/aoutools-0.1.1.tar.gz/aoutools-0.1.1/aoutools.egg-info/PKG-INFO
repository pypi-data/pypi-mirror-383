# aoutools: Tools for All of Us Researcher Workbench

aoutools is a Python library designed to simplify common analysis tasks on the
All of Us Researcher Workbench.

The initial release focuses on the `aoutools.prs` submodule, which offers
convenient functions for:

1.  **Reading PRS Weights Files:** A flexible reader that can handle various
    file formats, both with and without headers.
2.  **Calculating PRS:** A cost-efficient strategy for calculating PRS directly
    on the All of Us VDS, with support for batch mode to calculate multiple
    scores at once.

You can install `aoutools` via `pip` using either the Python Package Index
(PyPI) or its GitHub repository. On the All of Us Researcher Workbench, you can
run the following commands directly in a Jupyter Notebook cell.

```bash
# 1. From PyPI
!pip install aoutools

# 2. From Github
!pip install git+https://github.com/dokyoonkimlab/aoutools.git
```

Please check the online [aoutools
Documentation](https://aoutools.readthedocs.io) for how-to guides and API
reference.
