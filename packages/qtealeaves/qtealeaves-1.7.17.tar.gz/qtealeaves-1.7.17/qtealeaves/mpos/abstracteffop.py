    Any effective operator or overlap.

    **Details**

    Effective operators should implement at least a dictionary
    functionality where the keys are made of a tuple of two
    entries, where each entry is the position of a tensor in
    the tensor network. The key `(pos_a, pos_b)` provides
    the effective operators of the tensor at `pos_a` contracted
    except for the link leading to the tensor at `pos_b`.
    The position itself can be implemented depending on the
    needs of the tensor networks, e.g., as integer or tuple
    of integers. Only each link needs a unique pair of positions.
