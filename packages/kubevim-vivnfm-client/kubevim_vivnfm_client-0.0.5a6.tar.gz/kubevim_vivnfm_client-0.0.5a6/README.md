    api_instance = kubevim_vivnfm_client.ViVnfmApi(api_client)
    body = kubevim_vivnfm_client.PbAllocateComputeRequest() # PbAllocateComputeRequest | 

    try:
        # This operation allows requesting the allocation of virtualised compute resources as indicated by the consumer functional block. Result: After successful operation, the VIM has created the internal management objects for the virtualised compute resource and allocated this resource according to the input requirements and constraints. In addition, the VIM shall return to the VNFM information on the newly instantiated virtualised compute resource plus any additional information about the allocate request operation. The VIM may also return intermediate status reports during the allocation process. If the operation was not successful, the VIM shall return to the VNFM appropriate error information.
        api_response = api_instance.vi_vnfm_allocate_virtualised_compute_resource(body)
