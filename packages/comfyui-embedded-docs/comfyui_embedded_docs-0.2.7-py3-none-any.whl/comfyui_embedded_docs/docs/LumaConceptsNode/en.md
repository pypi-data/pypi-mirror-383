Holds one or more Camera Concepts for use with Luma Text to Video and Luma Image to Video nodes. This node allows you to select up to four camera concepts and optionally combine them with existing concept chains.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `concept1` | STRING | Yes | Multiple options available<br>Includes "None" option | First camera concept selection from available Luma concepts |
| `concept2` | STRING | Yes | Multiple options available<br>Includes "None" option | Second camera concept selection from available Luma concepts |
| `concept3` | STRING | Yes | Multiple options available<br>Includes "None" option | Third camera concept selection from available Luma concepts |
