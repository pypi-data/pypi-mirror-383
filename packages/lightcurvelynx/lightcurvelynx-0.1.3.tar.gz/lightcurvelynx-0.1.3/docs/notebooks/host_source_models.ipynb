    "# Simulating Combinations of Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "For some intergalactic studies the user might be interested in simulating the *combination* of fluxes coming from an object and its host galaxy. LightCurveLynx provides a general purpose class `AdditiveMultiObjectModel` that produces the combined flux densities from multiple models. This class can be used to simulate host/object combinations, unresolved sources, etc.\n",
