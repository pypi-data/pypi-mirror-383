    "# Adding New Models\n",
    "\n",
    "A major goal of LightCurveLynx is to be easily extensible so that users can create and analyze their own models. In this tutorial we look at how a user can add a custom model to simulate an astronomical phenomenon that is not already supported by LightCurveLynx. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a new model node\n",
    "\n",
    "All models are subclasses of the `BasePhysicalModel` class in `src/lightcurvelynx/sources/physical_models.py`. This class implements a bunch of helper functions to handle parameters and simulate the output of an object. Users should not subclass `BasePhysicalModel` directly, but rather subclass either `SEDModel` (which generates temporal spectral outputs) or `BandfluxModel`\n",
    "(which generates light-curve-like outputs). Depending on the model type, users only need to override a small number of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For SED-type models, the user should override:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The `__init__()` method sets up the parameters.\n",
    "  * The `compute_sed()` draws effect-free observations for the object in the object's rest frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the object has a redshift value, the `SEDModel` class takes care of accounting for the shift in both times and wavelengths from the observer's frame to the rest frame (and back). So each model only needs to worry about generating fluxes in their rest frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Bandflux-type models, the user should override:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The `__init__()` method sets up the parameters.\n",
    "  * The `compute_bandflux()` draws effect-free observations for the object in the observer frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effects are applied within the helper functions, so users do not need to worry about calling them from `compute_sed()` or `compute_bandflux()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameterization\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the introduction_demo notebook, all nodes in LightCurveLynx accept dynamic parameterization. These are parameters that change with each sampling run. For example if we have a node modeling the model's output as a sin wave, we may want to include two parameters: the peak `brightness` of the object and the `frequency` of the underlying wave.  We specify both of these parameters with the `ParameterizedNode`'s `add_parameter()` function. Behind the scenes this function does the heavy lifting to understand how the parameter is actually set during each run (from a constant, another `ParameterizedNode`, the computation of a function, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Model Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example below, which implements the sin wave model.  There are some details in the implementation below that we do not cover immediately (such as the `get_local_params()` function), but will describe below. "

    "### Accessing a Node's Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `ParameterizedNode` is stateless by design, so it does **not** store the values for any of its parameters. Instead it stores information on how to get those values when sampled. Thus the `compute_sed()` function must take a `GraphState` object that contains the parameter information. This is usually generated with a call to `sample_parameters()`, but will also be automatically generated internally if the `evaluate_sed()` function is called without this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `compute_sed()` function can use the `self.get_local_params(graph_state)` to extract the current node's parameters from the `GraphState` object. This function returns a dictionary mapping the parameter's name to its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating the Node\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual evaluation (computation of the SED) of the model occurs through the object's `evaluate_sed()` or `evaluate_bandfluxes()` functions, which internally calls the `compute_flux()` (or `compute_bandflux()`) function. It is important to note that SED-type models can generate both SEDs and bandfluxes, while bandflux models can only generate bandfluxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users of the node should call the `evaluate_sed()` or `evaluate_bandfluxes()` functions, since these functions perform the necessary pre- and post- computations, such as shifting the wavelengths according to the redshift (for SED-models) and applying effects (for all model types). The developer of a model only needs to implement either the `compute_sed()` (SED-type) or `compute_bandflux()` (bandflux-type) functions, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** LightCurveLynx is set up to be modular with the foundation code performing most of the heavy lifting. This includes most of the functions in `SEDModel` and `BandfluxModel`, because these base classes are set up to consistently apply transformations and effects to all their subclasses.  New effects can be added by creating new subclasses of `EffectModel`. Thus the developers of new models should avoid overloading or modifying the `evaluate_` functions unless they need to fundamentally change how effects are applied."

We define another parameter as a function of that given parameter: `accretion_rate` is computed from the blackhole mass. For this second parameter, we feed information from other parameters into a function and return the result. \n",

    "LightCurveLynx's `FunctionNode` class provides a wrapper for such functions. The constructor takes in the function and a list of parameters. It can then be referenced directly to use its output to set parameters in other parts of the model. While the function we show below is simple (only one variable), we can use these types of function nodes to capture complex interactions.  For example the `BasePhysicalModel` function has the ability to compute an estimated distance from a given redshift and cosmological model."
