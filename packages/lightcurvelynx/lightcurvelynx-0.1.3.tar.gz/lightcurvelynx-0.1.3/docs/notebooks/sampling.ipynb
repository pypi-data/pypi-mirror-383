    "# Sampling Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we explore the mechanisms for sampling the parameters used to simulate physical objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time domain models are often defined by numerous *parameters* for everything from position on the sky (RA, Dec) to inherent physical quantities (hostmass) to purely functional parameters (curve decay rate). You can think of these parameters as the variables in the mathematical equations. For realistic models these parameters are not independent. Parameters may be sampled based on the values of other (hyper)parameters or computed directly from other parameters. For example an SN Ia model may use an X1 parameter which is computed from the hostmass and a C parameter which is sampled based on hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "LightCurveLynx provides a flexible framework for defining these relationships and sampling the parameters. At the heart of this sampling are nodes (or `ParameterizedNode` objects), which represent computational units for working with parameters. Each node defines a recipe for computing its internal parameters. Some nodes are simple computations for a single parameter, such as drawing from a Gaussian distribution or performing a computation of X1 from hostmass. Other nodes contain a series of related internal parameters that are used together. For example models (`BasePhysicalModel` objects) are themselves nodes with all the parameters for the object they represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the example of a simple SN Ia model. The nodes are shown in light blue, the fixed parameters as grey circles, and the sampled parameters as white circles. The blue arrows represent the dependencies between parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "![An example sampling graph](../_static/ParameterGraph.png \"Sampling Graph\")\n",
    "\n",
    "From an astronomical point of view, the model contains two objects: a host and a SN Ia. These nodes have parameters indicating position, redshift, and so forth. For this simulation graph, the position of the host is fixed but the position of the SN Ia is sampled based on Gaussian perturbations of the host's position. Redshift (z) works the opposite way. The host's redshift is sampled from a uniform distribution (defined by two fixed hyperparameters) and the SN Ia's redshift is copied directly from that of its host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter dependencies are set via the arguments of a `ParameterizedNode` or its subclass as we will see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined values of **all** the parameters in the graph define a single sample of the model's parameters.\n"

    "## GraphState\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ParameterizedNode` objects are stateless and do not store any information about the values of the parameters. Instead, all information about a given simulation’s parameterization is stored in a `GraphState` object. These saved values include not only the settings of the physical object being simulated, such as its redshift, but also parameters of prior distributions and internal bookkeeping values. Most users will not need to interact directly with the `GraphState` object, but we provide a quick overview here for completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can think of the `GraphState` as a nested dictionary where parameters are indexed by two levels. In the first level, the node label tells the code which object the parameter belongs to. This level of identification is necessary to allow different stages to use parameters with the same name. For example, in the graph above we can see that both the host and the supernova have RA values that might be very slightly different. If we are blending many objects, we could have a list of different RA values. In the second level of the `GraphState`, the parameter name maps to the actual sampled values.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example, let’s look at a static object with a parameter for brightness.  We use the `sample_parameters()` function to generate a `GraphState`."

Even though we only set a single parameter (brightness), the `ConstantSEDModel` object contains a series of other parameters that are inherited from the `PhysicalModel` base class such as RA, Dec, and redshift. Parameters that are not set use a given default value (in this case `None`).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the `ConstantSEDModel` object itself is stateless. In fact all `ParameterizedNode` objects are stateless. We do not store any of the parameter information internally. The nodes themselves are just recipes for operating on the `GraphState` object. This decoupling of state from the model objects ensures internal consistency between the parameters and allows for distributed computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating a single sample at a time adds significant overhead. If we want to generate 10,000 light curves from 10,000 Type Ia supernovae, we do not want to have to call the sampling function 10,000 separate times in a loop. For this reason, LightCurveLynx supports the vectorized generation of parameters and the `GraphState` objects also support the storage of multiple samples with a third layer of nesting."
