    "# Time Varying EffectModels\n",

    "The impact of an `EffectModel` can vary with time and wavelength (or filter). In this notebook, we show how to construct a basic time varying effect model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we model a Gaussian activation function, such as we might see if the contribution of an object to the observed flux followed a Gaussian curve over time. For example we might have a high proper motion star whose contribution to the current field of view varies with time and PSF as it moves into and then out of the field of view. The percentage of its flux is determined by the Gaussian smearing of the PSF."
