"""Basic setuptools.

This file is based on the GDA-Cookiecutter, version 3.1.2.
In most cases, it should not need to be edited by hand. In the unlikely scenario that
you need to change it in non-trivial ways, remove it from `.gda-cookiecutter_pathspec_tools`
so that future applications of GDA-Cookiecutter are easier to merge.
See https://gitlab.geomdata.com/geomdata/gda-cookiecutter/-/blob/master/README.md
for instructions on how to update to a newer version of the GDA-Cookiecutter.
