    "# Introduction to geqo\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, all features of geqo are presented and small examples are shown for how to use the features. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quick Start**: This section contains two small examples for a quick start.\n",
    "- **Unitary gates**: All build-in unitary basic gates are explained, i.e. these gates are not decomposed into other gates internally. \n",
    "- **Additional unitary gates**: More complex unitary gates, which are decomposed internally into sequences of other gates.\n",
    "- **Non-Unitary operations**: Explanation of operations like measurements or setting qubits.\n",
    "- **Sequences and Controls**: Basic constructions of circuits and controlled operations.\n",
    "- **Simulators**: All build-in simulators are presented and it shown how to simulate quantum circuits and how to get the results. \n",
    "- **Conversion to OpenQASM3**: In this section, the conversion of circuits defined in geqo to OpenQASM3 is demonstrated.\n",
    "- **Visualisation of quantum circuits**: Explanation of Matplotlib and Latex backends to create circuit diagrams."
