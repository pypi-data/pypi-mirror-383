class Sequence(QuantumOperation):
    """This class allows to gather operations together in a single operation. It corresponds to
    a quantum circuit. A circuit consists of classical bits, qubits and a sequence of operations.

    The list of classical bits and qubits are specified by the
    arguments ```bits``` and ```qubits```, which can be numbers or character strings.

    The argument ```gatesAndTargets``` is a list of tuples and each element of the list
    is processed in the given order. A tuple consists of a quantum operation and one or two
    target specifications. If an operation only affects qubits, then the target specification
    is the list of corresponding qubits. If an operation affects classical bits as well as
    qubits, then the first target specification is a list of corresponding classical bits
    and the second target specification is a list of corresponding qubits.

    For convenience, the parameter ```name``` can be used to assign a name to the sequence.
