# pyDMS
Python implementation of Data Mining Sharpener (DMS): a decision tree based algorithm for
sharpening (disaggregation) of low-resolution images using high-resolution images.
The implementation is mostly based on [Gao2012].

The DMS is trained with high-resolution data resampled to
    low resolution and low-resolution data and then applied
    directly to high-resolution data to obtain high-resolution representation
    of the low-resolution data.

The implementation includes selecting training data based on homogeneity
    statistics and using the homogeneity as weight factor ([Gao2012], section 2.2),
    performing linear regression with samples located within each regression
    tree leaf node ([Gao2012], section 2.1), using an ensemble of regression trees
    ([Gao2012], section 2.1), performing local (moving window) and global regressions and
    combining them based on residuals ([Gao2012] section 2.3) and performing residual
    analysis and bias correction ([Gao2012], section 2.4)

Additionally, the Decision Tree regressor can be replaced by Neural Network regressor.

## Installation
```python_dms``` requires GDAL to be installed on your system.
Since GDAL provides compiled binaries that vary by platform, this package does not bundle them. You will need to install GDAL yourself before installing ```python_dms```.

1. **Install GDAL**
    #### macOS (Homebrew)
    ```
    brew install gdal
    ```
    #### Ubuntu / Debian
    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y gdal-bin libgdal-dev
    ```
    #### Windows
    Download and install GDAL from GIS Internals or install via conda:
    ```
    conda install -c conda-forge gdal
    ``` 

    You can verify your installation by running:
    ```
    gdalinfo --version
    ``` 

2. **Install ```python_dms```**

    Once GDAL is installed and available in your environment, install python_dms with pip:
    ```
    pip install python_dms
    ```

    or download the project to your local system, enter the download directory and then type

    `python setup.py install`
