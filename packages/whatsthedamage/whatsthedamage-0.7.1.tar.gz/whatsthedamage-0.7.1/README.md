# whatsthedamage

An opinionated open source tool written in Python to process K&H HU's bank account transaction exports in CSV files.

The predefined settings works best with CSVs exported from K&H HU, efforts were made to be able to customize the behavior and potentially work with any other CSV format other finance companies may produce.

The project contains a command line tool as well as a web interface for easier usage.

An experimental Machine Learning model is also available to help reducing the burden of writing regular expressions.

_The slang phrase "what's the damage?" is often used to ask about the cost or price of something, typically in a casual or informal context. The phrase is commonly used in social settings, especially when discussing expenses or the results of an event._

## Features
 - Categorizes transactions into well known [accounting categories](#transaction-categories).
 - Categorizes transactions into custom categories by using regular expressions.
 - Transactions can be filtered by start and end dates. If no filter is set, grouping is based on the number of months.
 - Shows a report about the summarized amounts grouped by transaction categories.
 - Reports can be saved into CSV or HTML files.
 - Localization support. Currently English (default) and Hungarian languages are supported.
 - Web interface for easier use.

### Machine Learning categorization (experimental)

Writing regular expressions might be easy for IT professionals, but it is definitely hard or even impossible for others. Maintaining them can also be challenging, even for professionals.

Using a machine learning model can automatically learn patterns from a given transaction history, making categorization faster and probably more accurate without manual rule creation.

If you want to read more about the ML model used by `whatsthedamage`, check out its own [README.md](src/whatsthedamage/scripts/README.md) file.

The repository has an experimental pre-built model.  

The model currently relies on the English language. Language-agnostic models are planned for the future.

**Warning**
 - The model is expected to be opinionated. Predicted categories could be completely wrong.
 - The model is currently persisted using 'joblib', which may pose a security risk of executing arbitrary code upon loading. __Use the model you trust; use it at your own risk.__

Try experimenting with it by providing the `--ml` command line argument to `whatsthedamage`.

## Install

This chapter describes how to install `whatsthedamage` in production. For development purposes check out the [Development](#development) chapter.

### Manual install

The package is published to [https://pypi.org/project/whatsthedamage/](https://pypi.org/project/whatsthedamage/) therefore you can use pip / pipx to install it.
```shell
$ pipx install whatsthedamage
$ pip install --user whatsthedamage
```

The web interface requires you to start WSGI server (ie. gunicorn) manually.

Gunicorn requires either a configuration file or proper command line arguments passed when invoked from command line.

The repository contains an example [gunicorn_conf.py](gunicorn_conf.py) you can use out of the box.

```shell
$ cd
$ gunicorn --config gunicorn_conf.py whatsthedamage.app:app
```

### Docker image

There is also an experimental Docker image you can use hosted on GitHub.

```shell
$ docker run --rm -ti --publish 5000:5000/tcp ghcr.io/abalage/whatsthedamage:latest
```

You can access the web interface on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

```

### Configuration File

The config file format and syntax has considerably changed in v0.6.0 (JSON to YAML). Please refer to the default config file for details.

A default configuration file is provided as [config.yml.default](docs/config.yml.default).

If you do not want to create a configuration file then you can try the experimental [Machine Learning](#machine-learning-categorization-experimental) mode to categorize transactions.

### Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot why a transaction was assigned to a particular category, enable verbose mode using the `-v` or `--verbose` command line option.  
By default, only the attributes (columns) specified by `selected_attributes` in the configuration file are displayed. The `category` attribute is generated by the tool.

Should you want to check your regular expressions then you can use a handy online tool like https://regex101.com/.

Note: Regexp values are not stored as raw strings, so watch out for possible backslashes. For more information, see [What exactly is a raw string regex and how can you use it?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12871066/what-exactly-is-a-raw-string-regex-and-how-can-you-use-it).

## Transaction categories

This is the list of transaction categories `whatsthedamage` uses by default.

- **Balance**: Your total balance per time period. Basically the sum of all deposits minus the sum of all your purchases.
- **Clothes**: Clothing related purchases.
- **Deposit**: Money added to the account, such as direct deposits from employers, cash deposits, or transfers from other accounts.
- **Fee**: Charges applied by the bank, such as monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, or ATM fees.
- **Grocery**: Everything considered to sustain your life. Mostly food and other basic things required by your household.
- **Health**: Medicines, vising a doctor, etc.
- **Home Maintenance**: Spendings on your housing, maintencance, reconstruction, etc.
- **Interest**: Earnings on the account balance, typically seen in savings accounts or interest-bearing checking accounts.
- **Loan**: Any type of loans, mortgage.
- **Other**: Any transactions which do not fit into any of the other categories.
- **Payment**: Scheduled payments for bills or loans, which can be set up as automatic payments.
- **Refund**: Money returned to the account, often from returned purchases or corrections of previous transactions.
- **Sports Recreation**: Spending related to sports and recreations like massage, going into a bar or cinema.
- **Transfer**: Movements of money between accounts, either within the same bank or to different banks.
- **Utility**: Regular, monthly recurring payments for stuff like Rent, Electricity, Gas, Water, Phone bills, etc.
- **Vehicle**: All purchases - except Insurance - related to owning a vehicle.
- **Withdrawal**: Money taken out of the account, including ATM withdrawals, cash withdrawals at the bank, and electronic transfers.

Custom categories can be user-defined via config. Feel free to add your own categories into config.yml.

Note: the Machine Learning model was trained on the categories listed here.

## Limitations

- The categorization process may fail to categorize transactions because of the quality of the regular expressions / ML model. The transaction might be categorized as 'other'.
- The tool assumes that account exports only use a single currency.

## Development

The repository comes with a Makefile using 'GNU make' to automatize recurring actions. Here is the usage of the Makefile.

```shell
$ make help
Development workflow:
  dev            - Create venv, install pip-tools, sync all requirements
  web            - Run Flask development server
  test           - Run tests using tox
  image          - Build Podman image with version tag
  lang           - Extract translatable strings to English .pot file
  docs           - Build Sphinx documentation

Dependency management:
  compile-deps   - Compile requirements files from pyproject.toml
  update-deps    - Update requirements to latest versions
  compile-deps-secure - Generate requirements with hashes

Cleanup:
  clean          - Clean up build files
  mrproper       - Clean + remove virtual environment
```

### Localization

The application by default uses the English language, however it also supports Hungarian language.

For translation support the tool uses Python's [gettext](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html) library.

1. To update the English .pot file with new translatable strings use `make lang`.
```shell
$ make lang
```
2. Create or edit the .po file to add translations by a tool like `poedit`.
```shell
$ poedit locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po
```
3. Compile the .po file into a .mo file. (`poedit` will do this for you):
```bash
$ msgfmt locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po -o locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo
```
