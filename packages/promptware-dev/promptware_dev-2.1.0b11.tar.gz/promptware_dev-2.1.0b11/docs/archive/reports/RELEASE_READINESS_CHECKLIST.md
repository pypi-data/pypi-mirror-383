## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### DSL Limitations (Acceptable for v1.0)
1. **Type System**: No nested types, generics, optionals
   - Impact: Medium
   - Workaround: Use `object` for complex types
   - Future: Extend DSL in v2.0

2. **Middleware**: CORS, auth, rate limiting not configurable
   - Impact: Low
   - Workaround: Add manually in generated code
   - Future: Add middleware section to DSL

3. **Handler Logic**: Stubs only, no implementation preservation
   - Impact: Expected behavior
   - Workaround: N/A (by design)
   - Future: May add code preservation option

### Technical Limitations (Acceptable)
1. **Framework Detection**: Reverse parsers detect framework but info is lost
2. **Comments**: Not preserved during translation
3. **Custom Decorators**: Language-specific features not translated

**All limitations are documented and acceptable for production release.**
