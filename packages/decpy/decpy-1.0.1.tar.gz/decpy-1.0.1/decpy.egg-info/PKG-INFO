The DecPy library integrates lazy evaluation and three types of declarative programming into the Python:
1. tuple calculus (analog of the SQL)
2. domain calculus (analog of QBE)
3. first-order predicate calculus (analog of Prolog, logic programming).

DecPy allows you to work with collections in Python as with databases or expert systems (including writing recursive queries and even proving theorems).
