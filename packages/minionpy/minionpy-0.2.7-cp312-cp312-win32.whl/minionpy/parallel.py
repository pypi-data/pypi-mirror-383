    Initializer function to create a per-process instance.

    This function is called when a new process is initialized. It creates an 
    instance of the specified class (`class_name`) with the provided arguments 
    (`args` and `kwargs`). The instance is stored in the global `_instance` 
    variable so that it can be accessed by the worker function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    class_name : class
        The class to instantiate.
    args : tuple
        Positional arguments to pass to the class constructor.
    kwargs : dict

    Worker function to evaluate the objective function.

    This function is executed by each worker process. It evaluates the objective 
    function for a given input (`x`) using the instance of the class created 
    during initialization. The result is returned along with the input index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : list or numpy.ndarray
        The input data for the objective function evaluation.
    index : int
        The index of the current input `x` for result tracking.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple containing the index and the result of the objective function 
        evaluation.

class Process_Parallel:
    """
    Parallelizes the evaluation of an objective function using multiple processes.

    This class uses a process pool executor to parallelize the evaluation of the 
    objective function across multiple processes. Each process is provided its own 
    instance of the `class_name` class, ensuring independence between processes 
    and enabling the use of multiple CPU cores for computation.

    Working Principle:

    - When the `objective` method is called, a list of inputs (`X`) is passed, and the 
      function evaluations are distributed across the available processes.
    - Each process calls the `__get_instance` method, which ensures that each process 
      gets its own instance of the class `class_name`. This avoids issues that may arise 
      when sharing objects between processes.
    - The `__calc_func` method evaluates the objective function for each input `x` by 
      calling the `objective_function` method of the process-local instance.
    - The results are collected from the processes as they complete, and the final output 
      is returned after all evaluations have finished.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Nprocesses : int
        The number of processes to use for parallel processing.
    class_name : class

    args : tuple
        Positional arguments passed to the class constructor.
    kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments passed to the class constructor.
    
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the provided class does not have an 'objective_function' method, 
        which is required for the parallel execution.

class Thread_Parallel:

    Parallelizes the evaluation of an objective function using multiple threads.

    This class uses a thread pool executor to parallelize the evaluation of the

    instance of the `class_name` class, ensuring thread safety and allowing 
    the objective function to be evaluated independently on each input. 

    Working Principle:

    - When the `objective` method is called, a list of inputs (`X`) is passed, and the 
      function evaluations are distributed across the available threads.
    - Each thread calls the `__get_instance` method, which ensures that each thread 
      gets its own instance of the class `class_name`. This avoids race conditions by 
      ensuring that each thread works with a separate object.
    - The `__calc_func` method evaluates the objective function for each input `x` by 
      calling the `objective_function` method of the thread-local instance.
    - The results are collected from the threads as they complete, and the final output
