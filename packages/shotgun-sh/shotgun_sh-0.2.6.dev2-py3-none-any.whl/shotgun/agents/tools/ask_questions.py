    """Ask the human multiple questions sequentially and return all Q&A pairs.

    This tool will display questions one at a time with progress indicators
    (e.g., "Question 1 of 5") and collect all answers before returning them
    formatted together. This provides a better UX than asking questions one by one,
    as users can see their progress and don't need to use multiline input.

    Do not ask 1 question with multiple parts, or multiple questions inside of it.
    Structure it so each question can be answered independently.

    Args:
        questions: List of questions to ask the user. Each question should be readable,
            clear, and easy to understand. Use Markdown formatting. Make key phrases
            and words stand out. Questions will be asked in the order provided.

    Returns:
        All questions and answers formatted as:
        "Q1: {question1}\\nA1: {answer1}\\n\\nQ2: {question2}\\nA2: {answer2}\\n\\n..."
