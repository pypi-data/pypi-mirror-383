    "The [transportation problem](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics)>) is concerned with finding how much it costs to move mass (represented as a probability measure) to another arrangement or distribution (i.e. another probability measure). Probability measures appear naturally from many sources. Instead of considering a single measure one might index these and consider the notion of process. The simplest processes are [Markov Chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) which indexed by positive integers, i.e. [discrete time Markov Chains (DTMC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time_Markov_chain). We provide and un-pack the following standard defintion for clarity."

Adding a practical dimension, we have coin flipping deciding a state and fixed rules deciding state in the other. It would be desirable to have a way to separate these situations.
