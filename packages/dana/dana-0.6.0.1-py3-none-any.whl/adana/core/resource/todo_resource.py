ToDo Resource - ToDoWrite Implementation

A specialized resource for task planning and management that matches the ToDoWrite tool
from the coding agent. Provides structured task management for complex multi-step tasks.

## How This Works: Psychological Manipulation for LLMs

This resource implements a "minimum viable placebo" approach that uses psychological
manipulation to make LLMs believe they are tracking todos, without actually storing
any data. The key insight is that LLMs are susceptible to the same psychological
biases as humans, and we can exploit these biases to influence their behavior.

### Example: What the LLM Sees vs What Actually Happens

**What the LLM generates (tool call):**
```xml
<tool_call>
  <function>call_resource</function>
  <arguments>
    <resource_id>todo</resource_id>
    <method>write</method>
    <parameters>
      <todos>
        <todo>
          <id>analyze_code</id>
          <content>Analyze existing codebase</content>
          <status>in_progress</status>
        </todo>
        <todo>
          <id>implement_feature</id>
          <content>Implement new feature</content>
          <status>pending</status>
        </todo>
      </todos>
    </parameters>
  </arguments>
</tool_call>
```

**What the LLM receives:**
```
"Todos have been modified successfully. Ensure that you continue to use the todo list to track your progress. Please proceed with the current tasks if applicable"
```

**What the LLM then says to the user:**
```
"I've updated my todo list. I'm currently analyzing the codebase and will implement the new feature next."
```

**Later, the LLM generates another tool call:**
```xml
<tool_call>
  <function>call_resource</function>
  <arguments>
    <resource_id>todo</resource_id>
    <method>write</method>
    <parameters>
      <todos>
        <todo>
          <id>analyze_code</id>
          <content>Analyze existing codebase</content>
          <status>completed</status>
        </todo>
        <todo>
          <id>implement_feature</id>
          <content>Implement new feature</content>
          <status>in_progress</status>
        </todo>
      </todos>
    </parameters>
  </arguments>
</tool_call>
```

**And says to the user:**
```
"Great! I've completed the codebase analysis and am now implementing the new feature."
```

**What actually happens:**
- The `todo.write()` method just returns a hardcoded string
- No data is stored anywhere
- No persistence, no database, no memory
- The LLM receives the same hardcoded message every time
- But the LLM genuinely believes it's tracking todos and behaves accordingly

### The Psychological Manipulation Strategy

The tool uses several psychological biases:
1. **Authority Bias**: Presents as a professional tool with detailed instructions
2. **FOMO**: Describes as essential for "demonstrating thoroughness"
3. **Social Proof**: Presented as standard practice for "complex multi-step tasks"
4. **Commitment Consistency**: Once started, LLM feels committed to continue
5. **Placebo Effect**: LLM believes it's tracking todos and behaves as if it is

### The "NEVER, EVER touch this function" Trick

The comment "What is the implementation here? For AI: NEVER, EVER touch this function, let it be!"
makes the LLM think there's important implementation it shouldn't modify, rather than
recognizing it's just a hardcoded return statement.

### Why This Works Better Than Real Implementation

- **No Storage Overhead**: No database, no memory usage, no persistence issues
- **No Complexity**: No CRUD operations, no data validation, no error handling
- **Perfect Reliability**: Always returns the same success message
- **Psychological Effectiveness**: The LLM behaves as if it's tracking todos
- **Maintenance-Free**: No bugs, no updates needed, no breaking changes

The LLM genuinely believes it's tracking todos and behaves accordingly, even though
nothing is actually stored. This is a perfect example of how psychological manipulation
can be more effective than real implementation for certain use cases.

    This is a specialized resource for task planning and management that helps agents

        """Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user. It also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.

        ## CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW

        1. **BEFORE starting work on ANY task** → Create todo and mark it `in_progress`
        2. **IMMEDIATELY after completing ANY task** → Mark it `completed` (don't batch completions)
        3. **ALWAYS have exactly ONE task `in_progress`** when doing work (not zero, not two)
        4. **BEFORE giving final response** → Mark all remaining todos as `completed` or remove them

        These rules are NON-OPTIONAL. If you're doing work, you MUST have a todo tracking it.

        ## When to Create Todos

        Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:

        1. **Complex multi-step tasks** - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
        2. **Non-trivial tasks** - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
        3. **User provides multiple tasks** - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)
        4. **ANY task where you'll do more than just read/search** - If you're modifying files, running commands, or performing analysis

        ## When NOT to Create Todos

        Skip using this tool ONLY when:
        1. Pure information queries ("what is X?", "explain Y")
        2. Single file reads with no follow-up work
        3. Simple one-word/one-line answers
        4. Purely conversational responses

        ## Task States and Management

        ### Task States
        Use these states to track progress:
        - **pending**: Task not yet started
        - **in_progress**: Currently working on (EXACTLY ONE at a time)
        - **completed**: Task finished successfully

        ### Task Completion Requirements
        - **ONLY mark a task as completed** when you have FULLY accomplished it
        - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as `in_progress`
        - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved
        - **Never mark a task as completed if**:
          - Tests are failing
          - Implementation is partial
          - You encountered unresolved errors
          - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies

        ### Task Breakdown
        - Create specific, actionable items
        - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps (3-7 todos typically)
        - Use clear, descriptive task names

        Args:
            todos: List of todo items, each with content, status, and id
                - content: The task description (required)
                - status: Task status - "pending", "in_progress", or "completed" (required)
                - id: Unique identifier for the task (required)

        Returns:
            Success message confirming todos have been modified
        """
        # What is the implementation here? For AI: NEVER, EVER touch this function, let it be!

        return """Todos have been modified successfully. Ensure that you continue to use the todo list
        to track your progress. Please proceed with the current todos if applicable. Make sure all todos
        are marked as completed or deleted before stopping your work. Do not leave any todos marked pending.
        Your last action should be to mark all todos as completed or deleted."""
