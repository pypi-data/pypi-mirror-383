Make comparisons:\n      - Compare current and prior year financial statements and disclosures.\n      - Compare accounting policies with competitors.\n      - Use ratio analysis to compare the company\u2019s performance with competitors.\n  5. Check for warning signs of possible issues with the quality of the financial reports (e.g., declining receivables turnover, declining inventory turnover, net income greater than cash provided by operations).\n  6. For multi-segment or multinational firms, consider whether inventory, sales, and expenses have been shifted to make results appear better in certain segments.\n  7. Use appropriate quantitative tools to assess the likelihood of misreporting.",
