**ðŸŽ¯ QUESTION CREATIVITY FRAMEWORK**:

**DIVERSE QUESTION TYPES** (mix these creatively):

1. **HOW-TO EXECUTION**: "How to calculate/determine X when Y conditions exist?"
2. **ANALYTICAL SCENARIOS**: "Based on X situation, how much Y is needed for Z outcome?"
3. **RESOURCE PLANNING**: "How much time/resources/capital needed to achieve X given Y constraints?"
4. **DECISION FRAMEWORKS**: "When should you choose X over Y in Z situation?"
5. **RISK ASSESSMENT**: "What are the warning signs that X strategy will fail?"
6. **OPTIMIZATION**: "How to maximize X while minimizing Y under Z conditions?"
7. **COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS**: "How does X performance compare when adjusting for Y factors?"
8. **PREDICTIVE MODELING**: "What will X look like in Y timeframe based on Z trends?"
9. **STAKEHOLDER SCENARIOS**: "How to present X findings to Y audience for Z decision?"
10. **CRISIS MANAGEMENT**: "What to do when X assumptions prove wrong and Y happens?"

**ðŸ”¥ REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES** (adapt to your domain):
- "Based on 20% growth in X metric, how much Y resource is needed for next period?"
- "How much investment is needed to achieve X outcome based on current Y trends?"
- "When do declining Z indicators signal fundamental problems vs. temporary issues?"
- "How to adjust X models when Y assumptions change mid-analysis?"
- "What are the early warning indicators that X strategy will hit problems?"

**ðŸ’¡ QUESTION GENERATION PRINCIPLES**:

1. **CONTEXT-RICH**: Include specific scenarios, percentages, timeframes, constraints
2. **MULTI-LAYERED**: Questions should require both analytical thinking and practical execution
3. **STAKEHOLDER-AWARE**: Consider different audiences (clients, management, teams, regulators)
4. **TIME-SENSITIVE**: Reflect real business urgency and decision deadlines
5. **RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED**: Acknowledge real-world limitations (budget, data, time)
6. **UNCERTAINTY-AWARE**: Include questions about incomplete information and changing conditions
7. **DOMAIN-SPECIFIC**: Use terminology and scenarios specific to this domain
8. **EXPERTISE-APPROPRIATE**: Match the sophistication level of this role

**ðŸ“‹ GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS**:
- Create 2-3 questions per leaf topic path
- Vary question types across the framework above
- Make each question feel like it came from a real professional situation
- Ensure questions would generate rich plans, facts, and heuristics
- Use specific numbers, percentages, timeframes when realistic
- Include edge cases and challenging scenarios
