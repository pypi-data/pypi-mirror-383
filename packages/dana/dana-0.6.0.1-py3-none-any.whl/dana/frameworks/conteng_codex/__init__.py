"""
Codex Minimal Context Engineering (CE) Framework

This package provides a minimal, runnable implementation of Context Engineering
focused on clear schemas and a small, working pipeline:
- ContextTemplate/Instance/Spec with token budgets and selectors
- KnowledgeAsset + DomainRegistry (inâ€‘memory) for templates and assets
- ContextArchitect that assembles contexts deterministically with caching
- A tiny example domain pack (simple_finance) to demonstrate usage

The goal is to be small, consistent, and usable in Phase A evaluations.
