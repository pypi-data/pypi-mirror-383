"""
EagerPromise: Transparent concurrency through immediate background execution.

High-Level Design Behavior:
EagerPromise implements "eager" execution where computations begin immediately
upon promise creation, running in background threads while providing transparent
access semantics to the caller.

Key Characteristics:
- **Immediate Execution**: Computation starts in background thread upon creation
- **Transparent Access**: Promises behave like regular values - accessing them
  blocks if not ready, returns immediately if delivered
- **Multiple Access Patterns**: Supports sync blocking, async await, and status checking
- **Thread Safety**: All operations are thread-safe with internal locking
- **Error Transparency**: Background exceptions are captured and re-raised on access

This enables "fire-and-forget" concurrent programming where you can create promises
for expensive operations and continue other work, knowing that accessing the promise
later will seamlessly provide the result when needed.

    EagerPromise with transparent concurrency through blocking-on-access.

    Design Philosophy:
    - Creation returns immediately (never blocks)
    - Background thread handles execution
    - Access before ready blocks until resolution (ensures transparency)
    - Access after ready returns result immediately

    This blocking-on-access design is intentional to provide transparent
    concurrency - users can work with promises as if they were regular
    values, and the system handles synchronization automatically.
