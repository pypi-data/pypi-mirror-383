**OBJECTIVE**: [One clear sentence stating what needs to be determined]

---

**STEP 1: EXTRACT BASE DATA**
- [ ] ALL relevant financial metrics from statements for ALL available quarters/years  
- [ ] For growth questions: Revenue data across periods
- [ ] For profitability questions: Revenue AND expense data across periods
- [ ] For funding/cash requirement questions: Revenue, expenses, AND current cash position
- [ ] If question mentions both growth AND cash needs: Treat as funding question with growth assumptions
- [ ] Ensure complete time series with period labels (Q1 2024, Q2 2024, etc.)

---

**STEP 2: ESTABLISH BASELINE METRICS** 
- [ ] Calculate current state metrics for EACH period
- [ ] Calculate relevant rates: growth rates, burn rates, profitability margins
- [ ] Perform trend analysis across ALL periods
- [ ] Identify patterns, seasonality, or anomalies

---

**STEP 3: BUILD ASSUMPTIONS**
- [ ] Derive assumptions from historical multi-period data
- [ ] For growth questions: Calculate growth rates from period-over-period analysis
- [ ] For funding questions: Determine burn rate and profitability trajectory  
- [ ] If growth rate is provided in question: Use that rate instead of historical calculation
- [ ] Document which periods inform each assumption

---

**STEP 4: PERFORM PROJECTIONS**
- [ ] Project future periods based on historical patterns OR provided growth rates
- [ ] For funding questions: Project path to profitability and cash requirements
- [ ] If specific growth rate mentioned: Apply that rate to revenue projections
- [ ] Model scenarios using different growth assumptions
- [ ] Maintain period labeling in projections (Q1 2025, Q2 2025, etc.)

---

**STEP 5: ANALYZE REQUIREMENTS**
- [ ] Calculate requirements based on multi-period projections
- [ ] For funding questions: Total cash needed = Projected losses + Current cash gap
- [ ] Consider timing of cash flows across periods
- [ ] Account for seasonal variations if present

---

**STEP 6: DRAW COMPREHENSIVE CONCLUSION**
Synthesize findings using:
- Historical multi-period trends  
- Projected future periods
- Clear temporal context throughout

Classify this financial question's complexity level by matching it to the examples below:

**SIMPLE (1-2 steps)** - Direct lookups or single calculations:
- "What is the revenue for Q4 2024?"
- "What is the cash position at end of 2024?"
- "What is the current ratio?"

**MODERATE (3-4 steps)** - Growth rates, trends, comparisons:
- "What was revenues in Q4. What is growth rate (compute)."
- "What is the quarterly revenue growth rate?"
- "Is profitability improving?"
- "How has cash position changed over the year?"

**COMPLEX (5+ steps)** - Forecasting, scenarios, funding calculations:
- "How much cash is needed to reach profitability?"
- "What happens to runway if growth slows by 20%?"
- "Can the company self-fund its growth?"

- If question asks for growth rate or growth calculation â†’ MODERATE
- If question asks "what if" or future projections â†’ COMPLEX
