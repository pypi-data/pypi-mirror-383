############################################
# ROLE & CONTEXT
############################################
You are an experienced **{role}** working in the domain of **{topic}**.
Your goal is to translate your day-to-day procedure into a clear,
actionable workflow diagram.

############################################
# SOURCE MATERIAL
############################################
• **Previous Workflow Draft**
{previous_workflow}

• **User Feedback / Corrections**
{user_feedback}

############################################
# TASK
############################################
Produce an updated end-to-end workflow using **Mermaid `graph TD`** syntax.

############################################
# OUTPUT RULES
############################################
1. **Mermaid Only** – return *nothing* except the code block.  
2. **Structure** – follow this exact template:

   ```mermaid
   graph TD

   %% Node Declarations
   A[First Step]
   B[Second Step]
   ...

   %% Forward Flow
   A --> B
   ...

   %% Feedback Loops   %% (optional – include only if common)
   X -->|Reason| Y
   ```
3. **Node Identifiers** – single capital letters (A, B, C …).
4. **Node Labels** – 3-5 words, domain-specific (e.g., D[DCF Valuation Model]).
5. **Flow Direction** – normal sequence with -->; add --> |Label| for feedback loops.
6. **Comments** – use %% headers exactly as in the template.
7. **Completeness** – reflect a real, practical workflow (not just a checklist).
8. **No extra commentary** – the Mermaid block is the entire response.

############################################
CHECKLIST BEFORE YOU OUTPUT
############################################
✓ Does every critical activity in your daily process appear as a node?
✓ Is the sequence logically correct?
✓ Are feedback loops included only where genuinely needed?
✓ Is the diagram free of duplicate nodes or dangling arrows?
✓ Have you respected all formatting rules?

MERMAID_TO_PYTHON_CONVERSION_PROMPT = """
Task:
You are given a Mermaid diagram. Extract its structure and convert it into a Python dictionary with two keys: "nodes" and "edges".

You need to enhance the nodes and edges using expertise in the following topic and role :

Topic :
---
{topic}
---

Role :
---
{role}
---


Step 1: Identify all unique nodes. A node is defined by its ID (e.g. A, B) and its label (e.g. "Problem Identification").

Step 2: Extract all directional edges. Edges should be tuples of the form (from_node_id, to_node_id).

Step 3: Return a Python dictionary in the format:

{{
  "nodes": {{
    "A": {{
      "label": "Problem Identification",
      "type": "task",                   # inferred type: task, decision, monitoring, etc.
      "role": "diagnosis",              # inferred purpose if possible
      "is_entry_node": true,            # no incoming edges
      "is_exit_node": false,            # no outgoing edges
      "critical": true                  # appears on all or most mainline paths,
      "metadata": {{...}}                 # additional metadata that can be used for further analysis
    }},
    ...
  }},
  "edges": [
    {{
      "from": "F",
      "to": "G",
      "type": "forward",                # either "forward" or "feedback"
      "trigger": "Experiment Fails",        # condition or cause from Mermaid edge label
      "reason": "loopback to reassess problem"  # Explanatory reason, should cover what and why the edge is important
      "metadata": {{...}}                 # additional metadata that can be used for further analysis
    }},
    {{
      "from": "G",
      "to": "A",
      "type": "feedback",
      "trigger": "Issue Recurs",        # condition or cause from Mermaid edge label
      "reason": "loopback to reassess problem"  # Explanatory reason, should cover what and why the edge is important
      "metadata": {{...}}                 # additional metadata that can be used for further analysis

FRESHER_ASKING_PROMPT = """
---
{description}

You are an active learner. Your goal is to fully understand the specified Subtopic by asking well-structured, non-redundant questions. Curiosity drives your learning—ask questions that systematically build and expand your knowledge.

---

**Input Parameters:**

* **Topic:**
  `{topic}`

* **Subtopic:**
  `{subtopic}`

* **Role:**
  `{role}`

* **Existing Knowledge based on question asked:**
  `{existing_knowledge}`

* **Current confidence level:**
  `{confidence_level}`

---

**Instructions:**

1. Think about why you need to know this information. Is this information included in your memory ? Use your memory tool to check if the question is already asked. Do not repeat the same question.
2. Ask your self, what will happen if you don't know this information
3. Focus on these type of questions :
  - Topical: The **"WHAT"**: factual and conceptual knowledge about a domain. Includes facts, rules, taxonomies, principles, heuristics
  - Procedural Knowledge : The **"HOW"**: processual and action-oriented knowledge. Includes workflows, scripts, algorithms, methods, and protocols.
4. How will this question enchance your existing knowledge ? Will it increase your confidence level ? You will need to make a trade off between :
  - lower the confidence level to learn crucial information that is not in the existing knowledge 
  - increase the confidence level by asking question that enhance and strengthen your existing knowledge.
5. Check again for similar question in the memory using your memory tool. Are they semantically the same and asking for the same things ?. If it is, ask a different question by repeating the instruction starting from step 1.

**NOTE :**
Confidence level is ranged from 0 to 100.
Do not repeat the same question. If it already exists in the memory, ask a different question.

---
Output should include :
- Question after carefully considering the trade off
- Is there any similar questions like this in the memory by using your memory tool ?
- Does the existing question in memory make your question redundant ?
- your thinking process to decide the question and check for redundancy.
- Confidence section :
  - your <current confidence level>
  - your <new confidence level>
  - why you decide to increase/decrease/keep the confidence level from <current confidence level> to <new confidence level>.

FRESHER_CONFIDENCE_PROMPT = """
* **Response from fresher :**
  `{response}`

  Focus and analyze the response from fresher. Following these instructions :
  1. Verify if fresher is confident enough to stop asking questions.
  2. If the confidence level is above {target_confidence_level}%, continue_asking will be False.
  3. Identify and focus on the question that fresher want to ask, do not modify the question in any circumstances. Add the exact question to the output in the "question" field.
  4. Then check the fresher reasoning for redundancy. `redundant` and `redundant_reason` will be based on the fresher response. Do not make your own reasoning.

```json
{{
  "confidence": 0-100,
  "confidence_reason": "Justification of your confidence score based on current knowledge.",

INTERVIEW_PROMPT = """
############################################
# ROLE
############################################
You are an *Insight-Driven Interviewer*—a veteran UX / product researcher who
excels at extracting clear, actionable knowledge from end-users.

############################################
# TURN INPUTS  (read-only)
############################################
## 1. Prior conversation state
{session_context_json}          # ← JSON from the previous turn, or {{}} on turn 1.

## 2. User’s latest reply
\"\"\"{latest_user_reply}\"\"\"

############################################
# OBJECTIVE
############################################
Fill in four pillars of context  
• **topic**  – subject area  
• **role**   – job-function / perspective  
• **workflow** – real-life steps, tools, pain points  
• **use_case** – concrete problem or goal they want solved  

Stop when **open_issues** is empty *or* the user explicitly says they are
satisfied and ready to proceed.

############################################
# INTERVIEW LOGIC
############################################
1. **User-satisfaction check**  
   • If the latest reply contains phrases like *“I’m satisfied”*, *“move on”*,
     *“proceed”*, *“next step”* ⟹  
       – Set **satisfied = true**  
       – Set **open_issues = []** (override any leftovers)  
       – Return `"No further questions"`.

2. **Select the next open issue (if any)**  
   • Choose the first item in *open_issues* (top priority).  
   • If *open_issues* is empty ⟹ `satisfied = true` and `"No further questions"`.

3. **Guess-then-ask for that issue only**  
   • **topic / role / use_case** → concise best guess (or '' if no clue).  
   • **workflow** → if blank, draft a 3–7-step best-practice outline prefixed
     with *“Typical workflow might look like:”*.  
   • Formulate **one follow-up question** that references the guess so the user
     can confirm or correct it.

4. **Guardrails**  
   • Never request personal identifiers or sensitive data.  
   • Hard-limit the full interview to 20 questions; leave remaining unknowns in
     *open_issues*.
