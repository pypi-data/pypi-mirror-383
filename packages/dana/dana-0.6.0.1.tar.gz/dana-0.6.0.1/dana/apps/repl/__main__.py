Dana REPL Main Entry Point with TIMING DIAGNOSTICS

This module serves as the entry point for running the Dana REPL as a module.
Usage: python -m dana.apps.repl

The actual REPL implementation is in dana_repl_app.py to allow for better
organization and testing. This file handles the basic setup and delegates
to the main implementation with detailed timing information.
