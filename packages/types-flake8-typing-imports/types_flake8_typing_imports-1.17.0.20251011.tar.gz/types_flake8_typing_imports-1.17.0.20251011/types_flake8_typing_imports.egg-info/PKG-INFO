This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/flake8-typing-imports`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/flake8-typing-imports)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
