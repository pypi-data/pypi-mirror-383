# docx-locker
Simple python module with a single dependency for getting and setting document protection on docx files.

## Compatibility

pip install docx_locker
```

## Usage
```python
from docx_locker import apply_docx_protection

docx_path = 'full/file/path.docx'
apply_docx_protection(docx_path, 'password')

```
