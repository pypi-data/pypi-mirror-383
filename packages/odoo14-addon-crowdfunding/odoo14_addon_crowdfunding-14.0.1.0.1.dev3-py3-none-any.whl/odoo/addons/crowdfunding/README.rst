Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to Crowdfunding/Settings
2. Review the preselected crowdfunding product that is used on vendor
   bills to pay people

For the crowdfunding product, be sure to set (inclusive!) taxes that
make sense in your legislation. If you have default taxes set and
crowdfunding is tax free, add a 0% tax.

Usage
=====

The module provides backend as well as frontend functionality.

For the backend:

1. Go to Crowdfunding
2. Create a new crowdfunding challenge
3. Set at least a name and a description
4. Click 'Open'

For the frontend:

1. Navigate to /crowdfunding on your Odoo website
2. Select a challenge from the list
3. Join the discussion or add your pledge

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

As this module is designed to provide the bare neccessities, a couple of
other modules will add more advanced functionality

- crowdfunding_membership allowing to restrict creating/claiming to
  members only
- crowdfunding_project allowing to create crowdfunding challenges from
  projects/tasks or vice versa
- crowdfunding_github allowing to create crowdfunding challenges from
  issues of some github project
- crowdfunding_gitlab the same as above but for gitlab
- crowdfunding_category allowing to move some of the base company wide
  configuration to categories
