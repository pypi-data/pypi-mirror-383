Portions of this software were developed by the ARAMIS Lab for the Clinica project.
Initial code for the GTMSeg, ReconAll and TkRegister2 tasks were copied from
<https://github.com/aramis-lab/clinica-pydra-freesurfer>.

The basis for the remaining task interfaces defined in this package were semi-automatically
converted from Nipype interfaces (https://github.com/nipy/nipype) using the Nipype2Pydra
tool (https://github.com/nipype/nipype2pydra).
