"""
Creating a Simple Dashboard with Panel and Matplotlib
------------------------------------------------------

If you haven't already looked at the "The `get_result` Function" example, please do so as it
provides important context for how the `get_result` function can be used to build responsive
visualization tools by offloading the heavy lifting for visualization to the server side.

In this example, we will build a simple dashboard using the `panel` library to create a simple GUI
for defining a 4D STEM acquisition and visualizing the results in real-time.
