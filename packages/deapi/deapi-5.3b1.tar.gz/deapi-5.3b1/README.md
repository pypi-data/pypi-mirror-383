DE API - Python
===============

The DE API provides python bindings for basic operations for controlling Direct Electron's Mission Control Software. This API isn't functional without 
a working copy of Mission Control, (or the older DE Server) and a Direct Electron Detector.


Installation
------------

The python api can be installed using either `pip` or `anaconda`. 


Installing using pip

```bash
$ pip install deapi
```

Installing using conda

```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge deapi
```

Usage and documentation is hosted here.
