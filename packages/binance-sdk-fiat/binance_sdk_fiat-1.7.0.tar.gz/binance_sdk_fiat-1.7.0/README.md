This is a client library for the Binance Fiat SDK API, enabling developers to interact programmatically with Binance's Fiat trading platform. The library provides tools to get Binance Fiat SDK Deposit/Withdraw history through the REST API:
- [REST API](./src/binance_sdk_fiat/rest_api/rest_api.py)

- Inclusion of test cases and examples for quick onboarding.

## Installation

To use this library, ensure your environment is running Python version **3.9** or later.

```bash
pip install binance-sdk-fiat
```

## Documentation

For detailed information, refer to the [Binance API Documentation](https://developers.binance.com/docs/fiat/Introduction).

### REST APIs

All REST API endpoints are available through the [`rest_api`](./src/binance_sdk_fiat/rest_api/rest_api.py) module. The REST API enables you to fetch market data, manage trades, and access account information. Note that some endpoints require authentication using your Binance API credentials.

```python
from binance_common.configuration import ConfigurationRestAPI
from binance_common.constants import FIAT_REST_API_PROD_URL
from binance_sdk_fiat.fiat import Fiat
from binance_sdk_fiat.rest_api.models import GetFiatDepositWithdrawHistoryResponse

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
configuration = ConfigurationRestAPI(api_key="your-api-key", api_secret="your-api-secret", base_path=FIAT_REST_API_PROD_URL)

client = Fiat(config_rest_api=configuration)

try:
    response = client.rest_api.get_fiat_deposit_withdraw_history()

    data: GetFiatDepositWithdrawHistoryResponse = response.data()
    logging.info(f"get_fiat_deposit_withdraw_history() response: {data}")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"get_fiat_deposit_withdraw_history() error: {e}")
```

More examples can be found in the [`examples/rest_api`](./examples/rest_api/) folder.

#### Configuration Options

The REST API supports the following advanced configuration options:

- `timeout`: Timeout for requests in milliseconds (default: 1000 ms).
- `proxy`: Proxy configuration:
  - `host`: Proxy server hostname.
  - `port`: Proxy server port.
  - `protocol`: Proxy protocol (http or https).
  - `auth`: Proxy authentication credentials:
    - `username`: Proxy username.
    - `password`: Proxy password.
- `keep_alive`: Enable HTTP keep-alive (default: true).
- `compression`: Enable response compression (default: true).
- `retries`: Number of retry attempts for failed requests (default: 3).
- `backoff`: Delay in milliseconds between retries (default: 1000 ms).
- `https_agent`: Custom HTTPS agent for advanced TLS configuration.
- `private_key`: RSA or ED25519 private key for authentication.
- `private_key_passphrase`: Passphrase for the private key, if encrypted.

##### Timeout

You can configure a timeout for requests in milliseconds. If the request exceeds the specified timeout, it will be aborted. See the [Timeout example](./docs/rest_api/timeout.md) for detailed usage.

##### Proxy

The REST API supports HTTP/HTTPS proxy configurations. See the [Proxy example](./docs/rest_api/proxy.md) for detailed usage.

##### Keep-Alive

Enable HTTP keep-alive for persistent connections. See the [Keep-Alive example](./docs/rest_api/keepAlive.md) for detailed usage.

##### Compression

Enable or disable response compression. See the [Compression example](./docs/rest_api/compression.md) for detailed usage.

##### Retries

Configure the number of retry attempts and delay in milliseconds between retries for failed requests. See the [Retries example](./docs/rest_api/retries.md) for detailed usage.

##### HTTPS Agent

Customize the HTTPS agent for advanced TLS configurations. See the [HTTPS Agent example](./docs/rest_api/httpsAgent.md) for detailed usage.

##### Key Pair Based Authentication

The REST API supports key pair-based authentication for secure communication. You can use `RSA` or `ED25519` keys for signing requests. See the [Key Pair Based Authentication example](./docs/rest_api/key-pair-authentication.md) for detailed usage.

##### Certificate Pinning

To enhance security, you can use certificate pinning with the `https_agent` option in the configuration. This ensures the client only communicates with servers using specific certificates. See the [Certificate Pinning example](./docs/rest_api/certificate-pinning.md) for detailed usage.

#### Error Handling

The REST API provides detailed error types to help you handle issues effectively:

- `ClientError`: Represents an error that occurred in the SDK client.
- `RequiredError`: Thrown when a required parameter is missing or undefined.
- `UnauthorizedError`: Indicates missing or invalid authentication credentials.
- `ForbiddenError`: Access to the requested resource is forbidden.
- `TooManyRequestsError`: Rate limit exceeded.
- `RateLimitBanError`: IP address banned for exceeding rate limits.
- `ServerError`: Internal server error, optionally includes a status code.
- `NetworkError`: Issues with network connectivity.
- `NotFoundError`: Resource not found.
- `BadRequestError`: Invalid request or one that cannot be served.

See the [Error Handling example](./docs/rest_api/error-handling.md) for detailed usage.

If `base_path` is not provided, it defaults to `https://api.binance.com`.

## Testing

To run the tests, ensure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed, then execute the following commands:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run pytest ./tests
```

The tests cover:
* REST API endpoints
* Error handling
* Edge cases

## Migration Guide

If you are upgrading to the new modularized structure, refer to the [Migration Guide](./docs/migration_guide_fiat_sdk.md) for detailed steps.
