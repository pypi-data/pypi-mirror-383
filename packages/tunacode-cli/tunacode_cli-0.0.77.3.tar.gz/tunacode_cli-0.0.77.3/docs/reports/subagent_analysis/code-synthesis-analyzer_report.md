# Code Synthesis Analyzer Report

## Analysis Scope
- **Artifact**: src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py
- **Analysis Type**: Code Quality and Architecture
- **Date**: 2025-09-16

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Function Organization Problems
**Location**: Lines 104-476
**Severity**: HIGH
**Issue**: The `process_request` function handles too many responsibilities (372 lines)
**Impact**: Violates Single Responsibility Principle, difficult to test and maintain

### 2. Import and Performance Issues
**Location**: Lines 134, 214, 269, 317, 352
**Severity**: HIGH
**Issue**: Multiple dynamic imports inside functions
**Impact**: Performance overhead, poor code organization

### 3. Exception Handling Gaps
**Location**: Lines 138-141
**Severity**: HIGH
**Issue**: Bare except clause swallowing all exceptions silently
**Impact**: Critical errors hidden, debugging difficult

### 4. Magic Numbers
**Location**: Lines 203, 250, 359
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Issue**: Hardcoded values without constants
**Impact**: Business logic obscured, maintenance difficulty

### 5. State Management Issues
**Location**: Multiple locations
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Issue**: Direct state mutations without clear patterns
**Impact**: Potential race conditions, difficult to track changes

## Recommendations Summary
1. Move all imports to module level
2. Define constants for magic numbers
3. Implement proper exception hierarchy
4. Extract functionality into smaller functions
5. Create state management patterns

## Analysis Complete: No fixes implemented


Yes, that line gets the `tool_strict_validation` setting (which defaults to `False`), but the issue is that **even with `strict=False`, pydantic-ai still expects a dictionary object, not a JSON string**.

The problem is happening at the pydantic-ai validation layer before our JSON parsing logic can run.

**Quick fix** - Force `strict=False` explicitly:

````python path=src/tunacode/core/agents/agent_components/agent_config.py mode=EDIT
        # Force strict=False to handle JSON string arguments
        tool_strict_validation = False  # Override config temporarily
````

Or better yet, let's see what the current value is. Can you check your config file at `~/.config/tunacode.json` to see if `tool_strict_validation` is set to `true`?

If it's `true`, that's causing the strict validation that's rejecting JSON strings. Setting it to `false` should fix the immediate issue.

The real fix would be to intercept tool calls and parse JSON strings to objects before pydantic-ai validation, but forcing `strict=False` should stop the retry loops immediately.
