# Component Purpose Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the purpose and responsibilities of each component in the refactored TunaCode agent system. The architecture has been redesigned to eliminate triple redundancy and achieve a true single source of truth, with enhanced modularity and type safety.

## Core Agent Components

### 1. Response State Management (`response_state.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides enhanced state tracking using an enum-based state machine for agent processing phases.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Manage agent lifecycle states (USER_INPUT → ASSISTANT → TOOL_EXECUTION → RESPONSE)
- Provide backward compatibility with legacy boolean flags
- Enable robust state transitions with validation
- Track task completion and user response status

**Architectural Improvements**:
- Replaced ad-hoc boolean flags with a formal state machine
- Added enum-based states for type safety and IDE support
- Implemented state transition rules to prevent invalid state changes
- Maintained backward compatibility through property wrappers

**State Machine States**:
- `USER_INPUT`: Initial state when user prompt is received
- `ASSISTANT`: Reasoning and decision-making phase
- `TOOL_EXECUTION`: Tool execution phase
- `RESPONSE`: Results handling phase (may complete or loop back)

### 2. State Transition System (`state_transition.py`)

**Purpose**: Defines and enforces valid state transitions for the agent state machine.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Define transition rules between agent states
- Validate state transitions before execution
- Provide thread-safe state management
- Handle error cases for invalid transitions

**Transition Rules**:
- USER_INPUT → ASSISTANT (normal processing flow)
- ASSISTANT → TOOL_EXECUTION (when tools are needed)
- ASSISTANT → RESPONSE (direct response without tools)
- TOOL_EXECUTION → RESPONSE (after tool execution)
- RESPONSE → USER_INPUT (for follow-up interactions)
- RESPONSE → completion detection

### 3. Task Completion Detection (`task_completion.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides reliable detection of task completion markers in agent responses.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Scan response content for completion markers
- Support multiple marker formats (TUNACODE DONE:, TUNACODE TASK_COMPLETE:)
- Clean markers from final output
- Provide boolean completion status

**Supported Markers**:
- `TUNACODE DONE:`
- `TUNACODE TASK_COMPLETE:`
- `TUNACODE_TASK_COMPLETE:`

### 4. Tool Execution Components

#### 4.1 Tool Executor (`tool_executor.py`)

**Purpose**: Coordinates tool execution with fail-fast cancellation and handler instantiation.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Execute tools with immediate cancellation when operation_cancelled=True
- Manage ToolHandler lifecycle (create if None, reuse existing)
- Handle tool confirmation dialogs and plan mode restrictions
- Coordinate with prompt_toolkit for terminal interactions
- Provide graceful error handling for user aborts

**Critical Behavior Patterns**:
- **Fail-Fast Cancellation**: Checks `state_manager.session.operation_cancelled` before any processing
- **Handler Instantiation**: Creates `ToolHandler(state_manager)` only when needed, caches in `state_manager.tool_handler`
- **Confirmation Flow**: Uses `run_in_terminal` for synchronous confirmation dialogs
- **Plan Mode Enforcement**: Blocks write-only tools in plan mode with clear error messages

**Test Coverage**: Golden baseline tests in `tests/characterization/repl_components/test_tool_handler.py` with semantic anchor `8f5a4d92`

#### 4.2 Tool Buffer (`tool_buffer.py`)

**Purpose**: Manages tool call batching and buffering for efficient execution.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Buffer tool calls for batched execution
- Manage tool call lifecycle
- Handle tool call dependencies
- Optimize execution order

#### 4.3 JSON Tool Parser (`json_tool_parser.py`)

**Purpose**: Parses and executes tool calls from JSON-formatted responses.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Extract tool calls from JSON responses
- Parse tool arguments and validate structure
- Execute extracted tool calls
- Provide fallback for malformed JSON

### 5. Message Processing Components

#### 5.1 Message Handler (`message_handler.py`)

**Purpose**: Manages message construction and tool message patching.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Construct model request messages
- Handle tool result messages
- Patch tool messages for error recovery
- Maintain message context

#### 5.2 Node Processor (`node_processor.py`)

**Purpose**: Processes individual response nodes in streaming mode.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Handle streaming response parts
- Process text and tool call deltas
- Manage partial responses
- Coordinate with streaming system

### 6. Result and Response Components

#### 6.1 Result Wrapper (`result_wrapper.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides wrapper classes for agent responses with enhanced state tracking.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Wrap agent responses with state information
- Provide fallback response capabilities
- Handle different response types
- Support synthesis operations

**Key Classes**:
- `AgentRunWithState`: Normal run with enhanced response state tracking
- `AgentRunWrapper`: Wrapper for fallback responses with synthesis
- `SimpleResult`: Lightweight result container

#### 6.2 Agent Helpers (`agent_helpers.py`)

**Purpose**: Utility functions for common agent operations.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Create response messages
- Generate fallback responses
- Format progress summaries
- Handle user message construction
