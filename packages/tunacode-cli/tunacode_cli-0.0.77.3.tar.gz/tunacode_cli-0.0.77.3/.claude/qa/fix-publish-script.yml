problem: "Publish script not idempotent, fails on partial completions"
cause: "Script didn't handle cases where version was already bumped but publish failed"
fix: "Commit 966c9cb - Made script check existing version before bumping"
notes: "Script now detects partial completions and continues from last successful step"
