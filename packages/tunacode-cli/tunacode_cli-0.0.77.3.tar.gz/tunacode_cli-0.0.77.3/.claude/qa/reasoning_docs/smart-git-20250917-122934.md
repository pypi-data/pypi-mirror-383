# Session: smart-git-20250917-122934

## Context
- **Baseline**: 011acc9 (Sync local changes with remote on branch master)
- **Head**: 2433ad7 (docs: capture main agent refactor blockers)
- **Date**: 2025-09-17
- **Branch**: main-agent-refactor

## Summary
This session captures documentation and analysis work related to the main agent refactor. The changes include comprehensive Fagan inspection analysis, agent seam analysis, subagent reports, and a new main_v2.py implementation.

## Material Changes
- Added extensive documentation and analysis reports for the main agent refactor
- Created agent_seams.md (660 lines) - comprehensive analysis of agent integration points
- Added Fagan inspection plan, summary, and defects tracking
- Implemented main_v2.py as part of agent refactor preparation
- Added subagent analysis reports for code-synthesis-analyzer and codebase-analyzer

## Interface/API Changes
- No direct API changes - all changes are documentation and preparatory work
- main_v2.py is a new implementation but not yet integrated

## Debug/Investigation Notes
- No bugs or errors investigated in this session
- Focus is on preparatory analysis and documentation

## KB Update Locations
1. **File Classifications**: Updated .claude/metadata/file_classifications.json with all changed files
2. **Behavior Changes**: Should update delta_summaries as this represents significant refactor preparation
3. **Patterns**: No new patterns identified
4. **Cheatsheets**: No updates needed
5. **Debug History**: No debug sessions to record

## Next Steps for Future Agents
- Review the comprehensive agent seam analysis when implementing the main agent refactor
- Use Fagan inspection defects list to guide refactor priorities
- Evaluate main_v2.py as reference for the actual refactor implementation
