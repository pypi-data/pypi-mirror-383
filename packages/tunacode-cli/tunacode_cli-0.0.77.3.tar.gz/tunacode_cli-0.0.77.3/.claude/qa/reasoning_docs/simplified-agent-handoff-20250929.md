# Simplified Agent Handoff – 2025-09-29

## Problem
The existing simplified-agent plan had bloated historical context and lacked hard proof that premature completion persists. Successor developers would have needed to re-validate baseline behavior before coding.

## Evidence Collected
- `src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py:416` → Legacy `process_request` still spans 189 lines with productivity counters and multiple completion checks.
- `python - <<'PY'` (2025-09-29) confirmed `process_request spans lines 416-604 (189 lines)`.
- `rg "process_request_simple" -n src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py` → exit code 1 (helper not created yet).
- `src/tunacode/core/agents/agent_components/agent_config.py:168-189` shows system prompt still enforces `TUNACODE DONE:` markers when not in plan mode.

## Resolution
- Replaced the prior plan with a concise handoff document describing verification snapshot, proof artifacts, and a phased execution roadmap.
- Highlighted requirements for golden characterization tests, helper extraction, and removal of productivity-driven stop conditions in the new flow.
- Embedded knowledge-base touchpoints so future work updates `.claude/` alongside code changes.

## Next Steps for Builders
1. Create golden baseline test for legacy `process_request` completion behavior.
2. Implement `process_request_simple()` + `_execute_node_tools()` helper following the loop outlined in the handoff plan.
3. Add failing test for premature completion, then make it pass via the simplified path.
4. Update `.claude/` metadata (dependency map, call graphs, delta summaries) as the implementation lands.
