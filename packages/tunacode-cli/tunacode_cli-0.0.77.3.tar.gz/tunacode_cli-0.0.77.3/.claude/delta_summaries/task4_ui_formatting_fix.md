# Task 4: Standardize UI Formatting Patterns

**Date**: 2025-07-23
**Task Master ID**: 4
**Title**: Standardize UI Formatting Patterns
**Description**: Ensure the safety warning follows TunaCode's established UI patterns and conventions

## Problem Identified

The PRD mentioned that '[1] Yes (default)' was showing raw ANSI codes in the tool confirmation dialogs. Investigation revealed that `tool_ui.py` had raw `print()` calls that could cause formatting issues when using Rich console.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made:

1. **Fixed tool_ui.py line 181**: Changed `print()` to `ui.console.print()`
   - This was the main issue - a raw print() call after numbered options
   - Would cause formatting issues when Rich console is being used

2. **Fixed repl.py lines 436, 438, 439, 444**: Changed `print()` to `ui.console.print()`
   - Fixed shell command error messages to use proper console formatting

### Files Modified:
- `src/tunacode/ui/tool_ui.py`
- `src/tunacode/cli/repl.py`

## Verification

- ✅ No hardcoded ANSI escape sequences found in the codebase
- ✅ Code passed linting with auto-formatting
- ✅ All UI prompts now use Rich console formatting consistently
- ✅ No more raw print() calls in user-facing UI code

## Result

The numbered options '[1] Yes (default)' etc. will now display properly without ANSI code issues. All UI elements maintain consistency with TunaCode's established patterns using Rich console formatting.

## Notes

Did NOT change print statements in `agents/main.py` or `utils/system.py` as they:
- Are informational/debug messages
- Go to stderr (appropriate for logging)
- Are not part of the user-facing UI

# StreamingAgentPanel Dots Animation Fix

**Date**: 2025-08-11
**Component**: StreamingAgentPanel (src/tunacode/ui/panels.py)

## Problem
"Thinking..." dots animation wasn't appearing - content arrived too quickly (100-500ms) before dots could display.

## Solution
Adjusted animation timing:
- **Cycle**: 0.2s (from 0.5s)
- **Initial delay**: 0.3s for "Thinking..." phase
- **Pre-dated timestamp**: Triggers immediate dots display

## Key Changes
```python
# In StreamingAgentPanel._dots_animation()
time.sleep(0.3)  # Reduced from 1.0s
# Animation cycle: 0.2s per dots update
```

## Memory Anchor
Animation timing: 0.2s cycle, 0.3s delay for Thinking, 1.0s delay for content pauses
