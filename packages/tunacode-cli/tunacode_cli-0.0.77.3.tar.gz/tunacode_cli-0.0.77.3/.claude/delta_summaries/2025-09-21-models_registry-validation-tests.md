# Delta: Models Registry Validation Tests (Phase 3)

- Date: 2025-09-21
- Component: tests/unit/utils/test_models_registry_validation.py
- Change Type: Test additions

Summary
- Added validation tests to exercise Pydantic model constraints:
  - Negative cost fields raise ValidationError
  - Zero/negative limits raise ValidationError
  - String numeric inputs coerce to float/int for cost/limits

Rationale
- Complete Phase 3 (Blue) to validate behavior introduced in Phase 2 and ensure fail-fast semantics.

Impact
- Tests pass with the current implementation of models_registry.
- Confirms backward compatibility on attribute access (covered by golden tests).
