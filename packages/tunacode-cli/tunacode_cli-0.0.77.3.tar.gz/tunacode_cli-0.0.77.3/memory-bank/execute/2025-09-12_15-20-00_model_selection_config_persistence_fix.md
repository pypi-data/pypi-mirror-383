## Pre-Flight Checks
- **DoR satisfied?** ✅ - Research document completed, key files identified, git state clean
- **Access/secrets present?** ✅ - No special access required for config file operations
- **Fixtures/data ready?** ✅ - Test framework in place, characterization tests ready

## Task Execution Log

### Setup-1 – Read and understand the full plan document
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Notes: Plan document analyzed with 5 milestones, 8 tasks (T101-T502), and 5 gates identified

### Setup-2 – Create pre-flight snapshot and rollback point
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Commit: `5642b96`
- Notes: Git commit created as rollback point for execution

### Setup-3 – Initialize execution log document
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Notes: Execution log created and will be updated per task completion

### Setup-4 – Perform pre-flight checks
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Notes:
  - Test framework running successfully (310 tests collected)
  - Key files analyzed:
    - `src/tunacode/cli/commands/implementations/model.py:160-170` - Model selection logic with session-only persistence
    - `src/tunacode/utils/user_configuration.py:89-97` - Config persistence utilities
  - Current behavior identified: `/model provider:model` only updates session state, requires "default" keyword for persistence
  - All pre-flight requirements satisfied

### Task T101 – Characterization test for model selection behavior
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Commit: `(pending commit)`
- How to run:
  - `hatch run test tests/characterization/commands/test_model_selection_persistence.py -v`
- Files touched:
  - `tests/characterization/commands/test_model_selection_persistence.py` (new file)
- Tests/coverage:
  - 5 characterization tests created and passing locally
  - Documents current behavior: session-only vs. config persistence
  - Acceptance tests met: ✅
- Notes/decisions:
  - CONFIRMED: `/model provider:model` only updates session; `/model provider:model default` persists to config
  - Test file serves as both baseline and documentation of current behavior

#### T101 – Test Case Summary
- Model only updates session state (no file write)
- Model with "default" persists to config file
- Config file contents before/after command documented
- Multiple selections without "default" do not persist
- Documentation test summarizing the current behavior and target behavior

## Key Findings
- The bug is confirmed: requiring the "default" keyword to persist is counter-intuitive and causes friction.
- Current implementation in `ModelCommand._set_model()` only calls `set_default_model()` when the extra arg `default` is present.
- Persistence utilities in `user_configuration.py` are functioning as expected (save path, error handling); the gap is in when they’re invoked.

## Next Steps
- T102: Verify config file permissions and write access
  - Add explicit tests for permission errors and directory creation.
- T201: Modify model command to auto-persist selections (core fix)
  - Persist on direct model selection; keep session/config in sync.
- T202: Add user feedback for config persistence
  - Clear success/error messages on save.
- T301: Preserve "default" keyword functionality
  - Ensure no regressions; avoid duplicate saves.
- T401: Provider preference persistence for multi-source routing
  - Record preferred provider when multiple are available.
- T501: Comprehensive unit tests for new behavior
  - Include error paths and edge cases.
- T502: Integration tests with real config files
  - End-to-end verification across sessions.

## Todos
- [x] Read and understand the full plan document
- [x] Create pre-flight snapshot and rollback point
- [x] Initialize execution log document
- [x] Perform pre-flight checks
- [x] Execute T101: Characterization test for model selection behavior
- [x] Execute T102: Verify config file permissions
- [x] Execute T201: Modify model command to auto-persist selections
- [x] Execute T202: Add user feedback for config persistence
- [x] Execute T301: Preserve 'default' keyword functionality
- [ ] Execute T401: Add provider preference persistence for multi-source routing
- [ ] Execute T501: Create comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Execute T502: Integration testing with real config files
- [ ] Validate quality gates as you work

## Runbook / Commands
- Run characterization tests only: `hatch run test tests/characterization/commands/test_model_selection_persistence.py -v`
- Run full test suite: `hatch run test -q`
- Manual verification (after T201):
  - `/model openrouter:meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct` → should persist to config
  - Verify `default_model` updated in `~/.config/tunacode.json`

### Task T201 – Core Persistence Fix (Completed)
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Files touched:
  - `src/tunacode/cli/commands/implementations/model.py`
- Changes:
  - Auto-persist on direct ID selection, search single match, and interactive selection.
  - Calls `user_configuration.set_default_model()` after updating session state.
  - Preserves prior restart behavior only when `default` is explicitly provided.
- Validation:
  - Run a direct selection (e.g., `/model openai:gpt-4o`) and confirm config saved.
  - Check `~/.config/tunacode.json` has `default_model` updated.

### Task T202 – User Feedback (Completed)
- Status: ✅ Completed
- UX Updates:
  - Success message now indicates when selection is “saved as default”.
  - On persistence failure, shows error and warns that change is session-only.

### Task T301 – Preserve "default" Keyword (Completed)
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Behavior:
  - `/model <provider:model> default` preserves previous flow: saves and returns `restart`.
  - Non-`default` paths save and continue without restart.
- Notes:
  - Avoids duplicate saves; only one `set_default_model()` invocation per path.

### Notes on Tests
- Characterization tests document the old behavior and will fail post-fix for the non-`default` path.
- Plan to update/replace with new unit tests under T501 and add integration verification under T502.

### Task T102 – Config Permissions & Write Access (Completed)
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Files added:
  - `tests/unit/config/test_user_configuration_permissions.py`
- Coverage:
  - Creates config directory if missing and writes JSON
  - Updates existing config file contents
  - Raises `ConfigurationError` on permission errors
  - Raises `ConfigurationError` on invalid JSON load
