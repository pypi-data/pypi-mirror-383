## Pre-Flight Checks
- DoR satisfied: ✅ Yes
- Access/secrets present: ✅ Yes (local dev environment)
- Fixtures/data ready: ✅ Yes (existing config system)
- Git rollback point created: ✅ Yes (commit d5effd6)

## Task T1 – Configuration Comparison Engine
**Summary**: Create utility to compare user config with defaults and identify customizations
**Target**: `src/tunacode/utils/config_comparator.py` (new)
**Dependencies**: None
**Acceptance Tests**:
- Correctly identifies all default values
- Accurately detects custom settings
- Handles nested configuration structures
- Provides metadata for each configuration item
- Handles missing/invalid configurations gracefully

### Implementation Progress
[1] Started analysis of existing configuration system structure
[2] Examined `src/tunacode/configuration/defaults.py` for default structure
[3] Reviewed `src/tunacode/utils/user_configuration.py` for user config handling
[4] Designed comparator engine architecture
[5] Created `src/tunacode/utils/config_comparator.py` with full implementation
[6] Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/utils/test_config_comparator.py`
[7] Implemented recursive analysis for nested configurations
[8] Added type safety with dataclasses and type hints
[9] Created utility functions for loading and reporting

### Files Created
- `src/tunacode/utils/config_comparator.py` (new) - Core comparison engine
- `tests/utils/test_config_comparator.py` (new) - Comprehensive test suite

### Key Features Implemented
- Recursive configuration analysis for nested structures
- Detection of custom values, missing keys, extra keys, and type mismatches
- Summary statistics and health assessment
- Recommendation generation based on analysis
- Human-readable report generation
- Type-safe dataclasses for analysis results

## Task T2 – Dashboard UI Components
**Summary**: Build terminal-based dashboard components using Rich
**Target**: `src/tunacode/ui/config_dashboard.py` (new)
**Dependencies**: T1
**Acceptance Tests**:
- Renders configuration hierarchy visually
- Shows default vs custom states with clear indicators
- Supports keyboard navigation
- Handles terminal resizing gracefully
- Provides filtering and search functionality

### Implementation Progress
[1] Examined existing UI infrastructure (panels.py, console.py, model_selector.py)
[2] Designed dashboard component architecture with Rich
[3] Created ConfigDashboard class with comprehensive UI
[4] Implemented DashboardConfig for behavior customization
[5] Built overview panel with key statistics
[6] Created section tree visualization with hierarchy
[7] Implemented detailed differences table with filtering
[8] Added recommendations panel with health assessment
[9] Integrated sensitive value masking for security
[10] Added comprehensive test suite

### Files Created
- `src/tunacode/ui/config_dashboard.py` (new) - Main dashboard component
- `tests/ui/test_config_dashboard.py` (new) - Comprehensive test suite

### Key Features Implemented
- Terminal-based Rich UI with multiple panels
- Real-time configuration state visualization
- Visual indicators (✏️, ❌, ➕, ⚠️) for different difference types
- Sensitive value masking (API keys, secrets)
- Filtering by type, section, and visibility preferences
- Configurable sorting and item limits
- Comprehensive help system
- Integration with ConfigComparator from T1
- Health assessment and recommendations

## Task T3 – Startup Integration
**Summary**: Integrate dashboard into TunaCode startup sequence
**Target**: `src/tunacode/cli/main.py` (modify)
**Dependencies**: T1, T2
**Acceptance Tests**:
- Dashboard activates via CLI flag
- Integrates with existing startup coordinator
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Handles cancellation gracefully
- Works with all configuration scenarios

### Implementation Progress
[1] Examined existing CLI structure in `src/tunacode/cli/main.py`
[2] Added `--show-config` CLI flag with help text
[3] Integrated dashboard activation logic in async_main()
[4] Ensured proper priority handling with existing flags
[5] Maintained backward compatibility with all existing functionality
[6] Created comprehensive test suite for integration scenarios
[7] Added error handling for dashboard failures
[8] Verified that update check is skipped when using dashboard

### Files Modified
- `src/tunacode/cli/main.py` (modified) - Added --show-config flag and logic
- `tests/integration/test_startup_dashboard.py` (new) - Integration test suite

### Key Features Implemented
- CLI flag `--show-config` for dashboard activation
- Proper flag priority handling (version takes precedence)
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Graceful error handling for dashboard failures
- Integration with existing startup banner
- Skips unnecessary startup processes when showing dashboard
- Comprehensive test coverage for integration scenarios
