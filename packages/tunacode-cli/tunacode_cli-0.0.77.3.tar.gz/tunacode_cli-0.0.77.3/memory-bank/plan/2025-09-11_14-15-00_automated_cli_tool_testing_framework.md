## Goal
Create an automated testing framework that validates each tool's actual functionality within the CLI environment, ensuring tools work as intended when executed through the command-line interface, addressing the gap between unit tests and real-world CLI usage.

## Scope & Assumptions

### In Scope
- CLI tool integration testing framework
- End-to-end tool validation in CLI context
- Automated tool execution and result verification

- Cross-tool integration testing in CLI environment
- Performance and error handling validation for CLI tools

### Out of Scope
- Agent loop architecture enhancements (covered in separate research)
- Individual tool unit tests (already exist)
- UI/UX testing beyond tool functionality
- Network-dependent tool testing without proper mocking

### Assumptions
- Existing unit tests provide basic tool validation
- CLI REPL interface is the primary execution environment
- Tools should be tested in isolation and in combination
