## Goal
Implement automated release tooling to eliminate manual version synchronization across 3 files and streamline the release workflow from 4 manual steps to 1 command while maintaining existing GitHub Actions publishing pipeline.

## Scope & Assumptions
- **In scope**: Version bumping automation, release command creation, automated changelog generation
- **Out of scope**: Modifying GitHub Actions workflow, PyPI publishing changes, major versioning strategy overhaul
- **Assumptions**: Existing Hatch build system remains, developers want single-command releases, semantic versioning continues

## Deliverables (DoD)
1. **Release automation script** (`scripts/release.py`) that handles version updates across all files
2. **CLI release command** accessible via `hatch run release` that performs full release workflow
3. **Automated changelog generation** from git commit history
4. **Comprehensive test suite** validating release automation end-to-end
5. **Updated documentation** reflecting new automated workflow

## Readiness (DoR)
- Hatch build system available and configured
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated for release creation
- Write permissions to repository for commits and tags
- PyPI API token configured as GitHub secret (existing)
- Development environment with Python 3.8+ and dependencies installed

## Milestones
- **M1**: Foundation & Architecture - Create script structure and version management utilities
- **M2**: Core Automation - Implement version synchronization and release command
- **M3**: Testing & Validation - Add comprehensive test coverage and error handling
- **M4**: Polish & Integration - Documentation, changelog generation, and user experience refinement

## Work Breakdown (Tasks)

### M1: Foundation & Architecture
**T1.1**: Create release automation script structure
- Acceptance Tests: Script imports correctly, has main entry point, handles CLI arguments
- Files/Interfaces: `scripts/release.py`, `pyproject.toml` (add hatch script)
- Estimate: 2 hours

**T1.2**: Implement version file parsing utilities
- Acceptance Tests: Can read current version from all 3 files, validate consistency
- Files/Interfaces: `scripts/release.py` (VersionManager class)
- Estimate: 3 hours

### M2: Core Automation
**T2.1**: Implement version synchronization logic
- Acceptance Tests: Updates all 3 files with new version, maintains formatting, validates success
- Files/Interfaces: `scripts/release.py` (bump_version method), `pyproject.toml:8`, `pyproject.toml:173`, `src/tunacode/constants.py:12`
- Estimate: 4 hours

**T2.2**: Create release workflow automation
- Acceptance Tests: Performs git commit, tag creation, push operations in correct sequence
- Files/Interfaces: `scripts/release.py` (create_release method)
- Estimate: 3 hours

**T2.3**: Integrate GitHub CLI for release creation
- Acceptance Tests: Creates GitHub release with auto-generated notes, handles authentication errors
- Files/Interfaces: `scripts/release.py` (create_github_release method)
- Estimate: 2 hours

### M3: Testing & Validation
**T3.1**: Add comprehensive error handling
- Acceptance Tests: Handles git conflicts, permission errors, version validation failures gracefully
- Files/Interfaces: `scripts/release.py` (error handling and rollback logic)
- Estimate: 3 hours

**T3.2**: Create end-to-end test suite
- Acceptance Tests: Full release simulation in test environment, validates all file changes
- Files/Interfaces: `tests/test_release_automation.py`
- Estimate: 4 hours

### M4: Polish & Integration
**T4.1**: Implement automated changelog generation
- Acceptance Tests: Generates changelog from git commits since last release, formats properly
- Files/Interfaces: `scripts/release.py` (generate_changelog method), `CHANGELOG.md`
- Estimate: 3 hours

**T4.2**: Update documentation and integration
- Acceptance Tests: Documentation matches new workflow, examples work correctly
- Files/Interfaces: `documentation/development/publishing-workflow.md`, `README.md`
- Estimate: 2 hours

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger |
|------|--------|------------|------------|---------|
| Git conflicts during release | High | Medium | Auto-rollback mechanism, pre-flight checks | Failed git operations |
| Version file corruption | High | Low | Backup files, validation before/after updates | Version mismatch errors |
| GitHub CLI authentication failure | Medium | Low | Clear error messages, setup instructions | 401/403 errors from GitHub API |
| Breaking existing GitHub Actions | High | Low | Maintain same tag format, preserve workflow triggers | Failed CI after release |

## Test Strategy
**Primary Test**: `test_release_automation.py::test_full_release_workflow` - Simulates complete release process in isolated environment, validates version synchronization across all 3 files, git operations, and GitHub release creation.

## References
- Research findings: `memory-bank/research/2025-10-02_14-26-18_release_process_analysis.md`
- Current workflow: `.github/workflows/publish-release-v2.yml:6-73`
- Build configuration: `pyproject.toml:156-273`
- Version management: `.claude/development/version-management.md`

## Agents
- **context-synthesis**: Validate release automation patterns and best practices
- **codebase-analyzer**: Analyze current file structures and dependencies

## Final Gate
**Plan Summary**: Created focused automation plan for release process with 4 milestones, 7 tasks, and single comprehensive test. Addresses core pain point of manual version synchronization across 3 files while preserving existing GitHub Actions pipeline.
