    - *Example:* From now on, ask me questions until you have enough information to create a personalized fitness routine.

15. **Teach and Test Understanding:** Use prompts like "Teach me the [topic] and include a test at the end, but don't give me the answers and then tell me if I got the answer right when I respond".
    - *Example:* Teach me about the KVL law and include a test at the end, and let me know if my answers are correct after I respond, without providing the answers beforehand.

16. **Assign a Role to the Model:** Assign a role to the LLM.
    - *Example:* If you were an expert economist, how would you answer this: What are the key differences between a capitalist and a socialist economic system?

17. **Use Delimiters for Clarity:** Use delimiters to separate sections or content.
    - *Example:* Compose a persuasive essay discussing the importance of 'renewable energy sources' in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

18. **Repeat Key Words or Phrases:** Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt.
    - *Example:* Evolution, as a concept, has shaped the development of species. What are the main drivers of evolution, and how has evolution affected modern humans?

    - *Example:* Write a detailed paragraph for me on the evolution of smartphones in detail by adding all the information necessary.

22. **Request Style-Preserving Corrections:** To correct or change text without changing its style, use prompts like "Try to revise every paragraph sent by users. You should only improve the userâ€™s grammar and vocabulary and make sure it sounds natural. You should maintain the original writing style, ensuring that a formal paragraph remains formal".
    - *Example:* Try to revise every text sent by users. You should only improve the user's grammar and vocabulary and make sure it sounds natural. You should maintain the original writing style, ensuring that a formal paragraph remains formal. Paragraph: Renewable energy is really important for our planet's future. It comes from natural ...

23. **Automate Multi-File Code Generation:** For code spanning multiple files, instruct the model to generate a script that creates or modifies the necessary files.
    - *Example:* Generate code that spans more than one file, and generate a Python script that can be run to automatically create the specified files for a Django project with two basic apps for different functionalities.

24. **Continue Text with Specific Starters:** To initiate or continue text using specific words, phrases, or sentences, use prompts like "I'm providing you with the beginning [song lyrics/story/paragraph/essay...]: [Insert text]. Finish it based on the words provided. Keep the flow consistent."
