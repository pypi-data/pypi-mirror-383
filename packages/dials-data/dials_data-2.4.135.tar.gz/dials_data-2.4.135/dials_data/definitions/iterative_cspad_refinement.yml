    This test data is derived from the data used for the last panel of
    figure 3 in Brewster et. al. 2018, Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol
    74, 877-894 (https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798318009191)

    Specifically, the cspad.cbf_metrology command was used to find the
    best results from indexing thermolysin images and used those images
    to refine the cspad in 'expanding' mode, keeping the detector flat.
    Details here:

    Note, the paper refined 3000 images.  Here, the first 300 images are
    used.

    These files were originally located in the dials_regression
    repository. They are derived files created by DIALS processing with
    an unknown version of DIALS.
