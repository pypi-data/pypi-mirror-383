    This is a test case for joint refinement of the CS-PAD at hierarchy level 2
    (i.e. individual sensors) with 300 lysozyme crystals, from LCLS experiment
    LD91, prepared by Aaron and Nick. This data has been useful to benchmark
    refinement options and to target improvements by runtime profiling. Note,
    there are also 300 beam models, but these are all equivalent and will anyway be
    fixed during refinement.

    These files were originally located in the dials_regression
    repository. They are derived files created by DIALS processing with
    an unknown version of DIALS.
