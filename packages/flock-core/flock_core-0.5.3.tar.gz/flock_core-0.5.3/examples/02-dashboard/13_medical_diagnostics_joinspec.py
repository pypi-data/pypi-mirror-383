"""
JoinSpec Example: Medical Diagnostic Correlation (Dashboard)

Real-world scenario: Hospital diagnostic system that correlates X-ray images
with lab results for the same patient before sending to radiologist for analysis.

JoinSpec ensures both diagnostics arrive and are correlated by patient_id
within a 5-minute window.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features:
- Visualize X-ray and Lab result arrivals
- See correlation matching in real-time
- Track diagnostic report generation
