"""Example demonstrating MCP root/mount point feature.

This example shows how to mount agents in specific directories,
controlling which filesystem paths MCP servers can access.


CAUTION WHEN USING THE server-filesystem MCP-Server:

Due to the specific implementation of server-filesystem,
ONLY ONE CLIENT (AGENT) CAN SPECIFY ROOTS AT A TIME.

IF MULTIPLE AGENTS ARE ACTING ON THE SAME SERVER INSTANCE,
THEN THEY WILL OVERRIDE EACH OTHER'S MCP-ROOTS


From the Docs: (https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/filesystem/README.md)


Roots Protocol Handling (if client supports roots)

On initialization: Server requests roots from client via roots/list
Client responds with its configured roots
Server replaces ALL allowed directories with client's roots
On runtime updates: Client can send notifications/roots/list_changed
Server requests updated roots and replaces allowed directories again
