# ðŸ”Œ REST API Integration

> **Status:** ðŸš§ Coming Soon

This section will demonstrate how to integrate Flock with REST APIs and external services:

## Planned Examples

**01_fastapi_integration.py**
- Serving Flock workflows via FastAPI
- HTTP endpoints that publish artifacts
- RESTful agent orchestration

**02_webhook_consumer.py**
- Consuming external webhooks
- Event-driven workflows
- Integration with third-party services

**03_api_client.py**
- Agents that call external APIs
- HTTP clients with `@flock_tool`
- Rate limiting and retry logic

## In the Meantime

Flock already has API serving built-in:
```python
await flock.serve(dashboard=True)
# Dashboard includes REST API endpoints
```

For tool integration examples, see:
