# 🗂️ Blackboard Workflows

> **Status:** 🚧 Coming Soon

This section will demonstrate how agents collaborate through the blackboard architecture:

## Planned Examples

**01_parallel_execution.py**
- Multiple agents consuming the same type
- Automatic concurrent execution
- No manual coordination needed

**02_sequential_chaining.py**
- Agent A → Agent B → Agent C via type subscriptions
- Workflows emerge from type declarations
- No explicit graph wiring

**03_mixed_workflow.py**
- Combining parallel and sequential patterns
- Real-world workflow complexity
- Blackboard orchestration at scale
