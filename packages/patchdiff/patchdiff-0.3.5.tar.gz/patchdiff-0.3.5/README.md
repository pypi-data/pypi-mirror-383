# Patchdiff üîç

Based on [rfc6902](https://github.com/chbrown/rfc6902) this library provides a simple API to generate bi-directional diffs between composite python datastructures composed out of lists, sets, tuples and dicts. The diffs are jsonpatch compliant, and can optionally be serialized to json format. Patchdiff can also be used to apply lists of patches to objects, both in-place or on a deepcopy of the input.

## Install

`pip install patchdiff`

## Quick-start

```python
from patchdiff import apply, diff, iapply, to_json

input = {"a": [5, 7, 9, {"a", "b", "c"}], "b": 6}
output = {"a": [5, 2, 9, {"b", "c"}], "b": 6, "c": 7}

ops, reverse_ops = diff(input, output)

assert apply(input, ops) == output
assert apply(output, reverse_ops) == input

iapply(input, ops)  # apply in-place
assert input == output

print(to_json(ops, indent=4))
# [
#     {
#         "op": "add",
#         "path": "/c",
#         "value": 7
#     },
#     {
#         "op": "replace",
#         "path": "/a/1",
#         "value": 2
#     },
#     {
#         "op": "remove",
#         "path": "/a/3/a"
#     }
# ]
```
