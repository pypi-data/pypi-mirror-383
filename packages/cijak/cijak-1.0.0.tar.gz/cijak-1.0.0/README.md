# Cijak

A high-performance Unicode-based encoding library that packs binary data into CJK characters. Cijak encodes up to 14 bits per character, making it significantly more character-efficient than Base64 while maintaining competitive performance through optimized C extensions.

The name "Cijak" comes from the **C**JK Unicode block, where you can encode **14** bits of data (**C**1**J**4**K**).

## Why Cijak?

**Character efficiency meets raw speed.** Cijak is designed for scenarios where:
- Character count matters more than byte size (SMS, tweets, chat apps)
- You need Unicode-safe encoding that doesn't look like obvious Base64
- Performance is critical (300x faster than pure Python implementations)

### Performance Comparison

Benchmarked on 3.7KB of binary data:

| Metric | Cijak     | Base64 | Cijak (Python Fallback) |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------------------------|
| **Encode** | 4.21 μs | 3.78 μs | 1340 μs |
| **Decode** | 5.24 μs | 8.19 μs | 1338 μs |
| **Character count** | 2,120 | 4,944 | 2,120 |
| **Character compression** | **57%** | 133% | --- |
| **UTF-8 size** | 6,360 B | 4,944 B | --- |
| **UTF-16 size** | **4,242 B** | 9,890 B | --- |

**TL;DR**: Cijak uses **57% fewer characters** than the original, while Base64 increases character count by 33%. Encoding speed matches Base64, decoding is faster.

## Installation

```bash
pip install cijak
```

Pre-compiled wheels are available for:
- **Linux** (x86_64, aarch64)
- **macOS** (Intel, Apple Silicon)  
- **Windows** (x86_64)
- **Python 3.8-3.12**

If a wheel isn't available for your platform, the package automatically falls back to a pure Python implementation (~300x slower, but functionally identical).

## Quick Start

```python
from cijak import Cijak

# Initialize encoder (uses CJK Unicode block by default)
encoder = Cijak()

# Encode binary data
data = b'Hello, World!'
encoded = encoder.encode(data)
print(encoded)  # ㇈怙擆羼稠蔦羐漀

# Decode back to bytes
decoded = encoder.decode(encoded)
print(decoded)  # b'Hello, World!'
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Unicode Ranges

You can use different Unicode blocks for encoding:

```python
# Use a different range (e.g., Hangul)
encoder = Cijak(
    unicode_range_start=0xAC00,  # Hangul Syllables start
    unicode_range_end=0xD7A3,    # Hangul Syllables end
    marker_base=0x3200           # Different marker range
)

data = b"Custom encoding!"
encoded = encoder.encode(data)
```

**Important**: The Unicode range must not contain control characters. The library automatically calculates the optimal bit-packing based on your range size.

### Check Current Implementation

```python
from cijak import get_implementation

impl = get_implementation()
print(impl)  # 'native' or 'fallback'
```

If you see `'fallback'`, you're using the pure Python version. Consider installing build tools to enable the C extension for 300x speedup.

## Technical Details

### Encoding Scheme
- **Default**: CJK Unified Ideographs (U+4E00 to U+9FFF)
- **Bits per character**: 14 bits (calculated from range size)
- **Marker byte**: Encodes padding information (U+31C0 base)
- **Efficiency**: ~1.75 bytes per character (vs Base64's 0.75)

### How It Works
1. Binary data is packed into 14-bit chunks
2. Each chunk is mapped to a CJK codepoint
3. First character is a marker indicating padding
4. Remaining bits are left-padded in the last character

### Performance Notes
- **C extension**: Direct memory manipulation, zero Python overhead
- **Fallback**: BitReader/BitWriter abstraction in pure Python
- **Memory**: Single-pass encoding/decoding, minimal allocations
- **Thread-safe**: No global state, safe for concurrent use

## Building from Source

If you need to build the C extension manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NobreHD/Cijak.git
cd Cijak
pip install -e .
```

Requirements:
- C compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Python development headers
