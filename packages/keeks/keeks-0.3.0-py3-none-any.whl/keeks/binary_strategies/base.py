        Calculate maximum price willing to pay for a one-time gamble.

        This method is only implemented for strategies derived from utility theory

        Parameters
        ----------
        outcomes : array-like
            The possible payoffs from the gamble
        probabilities : array-like
            The probability of each outcome (must sum to â‰¤ 1)
        current_wealth : float
            Current wealth before the gamble
        tolerance : float, default=0.01
            Convergence tolerance for binary search
        max_search_fraction : float, default=0.5
            Maximum fraction of wealth to consider as upper bound

        -------

        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError

            calculating indifference prices.

        Notes
        -----
        This method answers: "What's the maximum I'd pay to participate in this
        one-time gamble?" It's fundamentally different from evaluate(), which
        answers: "How much should I bet in a repeated betting scenario?"

        Only strategies with underlying utility functions can meaningfully answer
        the entry price question. Heuristic strategies (e.g., FixedFraction, CPPI)
        don't have utility functions to derive indifference prices from.
