class MertonShare(BaseStrategy):
    """
    Implementation of the Merton Share strategy using CRRA utility.

    This strategy is based on Robert Merton's portfolio optimization problem
    with Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility. The optimal fraction
    to invest is proportional to the expected excess return divided by the
    product of risk aversion and variance.

    The formula is: f* = Î¼ / (Î³ Ã— ÏƒÂ²)

    Where:
    - f* is the optimal fraction of wealth to invest
    - Î¼ is the expected excess return (return above risk-free rate)
    - Î³ (gamma) is the coefficient of relative risk aversion
    - ÏƒÂ² (sigma squared) is the variance of returns

    For binary betting, we adapt this by:
    - Expected return is calculated from probability and payoff/loss ratios
    - Variance is estimated from the binary outcome distribution
    - Transaction costs are incorporated into the expected return

    Parameters
    ----------
    payoff : float
        The amount won per unit bet on a successful outcome.
    loss : float
        The amount lost per unit bet on an unsuccessful outcome.
    transaction_cost : float
        The fixed cost per transaction, regardless of outcome.
    risk_aversion : float, default=2.0
        The coefficient of relative risk aversion (Î³). Common values:
        - 1.0: Low risk aversion
        - 2.0: Moderate risk aversion (most common empirical estimate)
        - 3.0-5.0: High risk aversion
    min_probability : float, default=0.5
        The minimum probability required to place a bet.
    max_fraction : float, default=1.0
        The maximum fraction of bankroll to bet (safety cap).
