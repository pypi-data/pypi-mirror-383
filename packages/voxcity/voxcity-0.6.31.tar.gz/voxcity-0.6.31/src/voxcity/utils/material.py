"""
Material utilities for VoxelCity voxel grid processing.

This module provides functions for setting building materials and window patterns
in 3D voxel grids based on building IDs, material types, and window ratios.
The main functionality includes:
- Material ID mapping and retrieval
- Window pattern generation based on configurable ratios
- Building material assignment from GeoDataFrame data

def get_material_dict():
    """
    Returns a dictionary mapping material names to their corresponding ID values.
    
    The material IDs use negative values to distinguish them from other voxel types.
    Each material has a unique negative ID that can be used for material-based
    rendering and analysis.
    
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary with material names as keys and negative integer IDs as values.
              Available materials: unknown, brick, wood, concrete, metal, stone, glass, plaster

def get_modulo_numbers(window_ratio):
    """
    Determines the appropriate modulo numbers for x, y, z based on window_ratio.
    
    This function creates different window patterns by returning modulo values that
    control the spacing of windows in the x, y, and z dimensions. Lower window_ratio
    values result in sparser window patterns (higher modulo values), while higher
    ratios create denser patterns.
    
    The function uses hash-based selection for certain ratios to introduce variety
    in window patterns for buildings with similar window ratios.
    
    Parameters:
        window_ratio (float): Value between 0 and 1.0 representing window density
    
    Returns:
        tuple: (x_mod, y_mod, z_mod) - modulo numbers for each dimension

    """
    Marks cells in voxelcity_grid based on building IDs and window ratio.
    Never sets glass_id to cells with maximum z index.
    
    This function processes buildings by:
    1. Finding all positions matching the specified building IDs
    2. Setting the base material for all building voxels
    3. Creating window patterns based on window_ratio and modulo calculations
    4. Ensuring the top floor (maximum z) never gets windows (glass_id)
    
    The window pattern is determined by the modulo values returned from get_modulo_numbers(),
    which creates different densities and arrangements of windows based on the window_ratio.
    
    Parameters:
        voxelcity_grid (numpy.ndarray): 3D numpy array representing the voxel grid
        building_id_grid_ori (numpy.ndarray): 2D numpy array containing building IDs
        ids (list/array): Building IDs to process
        mark (int): Material ID value to set for building cells
        window_ratio (float): Value between 0 and 1.0 determining window density:
            ~0.125: sparse windows (2,2,2)
            ~0.25: medium-sparse windows (2,2,1), (2,1,2), or (1,2,2)
            ~0.5: medium windows (2,1,1), (1,2,1), or (1,1,2)
