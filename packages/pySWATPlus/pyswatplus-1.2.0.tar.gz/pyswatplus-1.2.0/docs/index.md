`pySWATPlus` is an open-source Python package that provides a programmatic interface to the [SWAT+](https://swat.tamu.edu/software/plus/) model, allowing users to run simulations and conduct custom experiments.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Modify model parameters through the `calibration.cal` file.
- Run SWAT+ simulations seamlessly.
- Compute performance metrics using widely adopted indicators.
- Perform sensitivity analysis on model parameters using the [SALib](https://github.com/SALib/SALib) Python package, with support for parallel computation; currently, only Sobol sampling and Sobol indices are supported.
