# Release Notes

## Version 1.2.0 (October 13, 2025)

- All SWAT+ simulations with modified parameters are now configured through the `calibration.cal` file, eliminating the need to read and modify individual input files.

- Introduced the `pySWATPlus.PerformanceMetrics` class to compute performance metrics between simulated and observed values using the following indicators:
  
    - Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency
    - Kling–Gupta Efficiency
    - Mean Squared Error
    - Root Mean Squared Error 
    - Percent Bias
    - Mean Absolute Relative Error

- Updated the `pySWATPlus.SensitivityAnalyzer` class:

    - Renamed the method `simulation_by_sobol_sample` to `simulation_by_sample_parameters` to standardize naming and allow different sampling techniques in the future.
    - Added `parameter_sensitivity_indices` for computing sensitivity indices using the available indicators in the `pySWATPlus.PerformanceMetrics` class.
  
- Introduced the `pySWATPlus.DataManager` class with methods to support data processing workflows:
  
    - `read_sensitive_dfs`: Reads sensitivity simulation data generated by the `simulation_by_sobol_sample` method in the `pySWATPlus.SensitivityAnalyzer` class.  
    - `simulated_timeseries_df`: Moved from the `pySWATPlus.SensitivityAnalyzer` class to improve modularity.

- Updated the `pySWATPlus.TxtinoutReader` class:
  
    - Added `set_simulation_timestep` to modify the simulation timestep in the `time.sim` file.  
    - Added `set_print_interval` to modify the print interval in the `print.prt` file.
    - Added `set_print_period` to modify the print period in the `print.prt` file for recording simulated results.  
    - Renamed `set_begin_and_end_date` to `set_simulation_period` for better consistency.



## Version 1.1.0 (August 26, 2025)

- Added a new class `pySWATPlus.SensitivityAnalyzer` to support sensitivity simulations with two main methods:

    - `simulated_timeseries_df`: Generates a time series `DataFrame` directly from a simulation output file.  
    - `simulation_by_sobol_sample`: Provides a high-level interface for running sensitivity simulations with parallel computing and extracting results from multiple output files.

- Changes in `pySWATPlus.TxtinoutReader` class:

    - `copy_required_files`: New method to copy required files into a separate directory before running simulations. This protects the main `TxtInOut` folder and enables safer, more controlled workflows.
    - `run_swat_in_other_dir`: Enhanced with new optional parameters, allowing users to configure all necessary inputs in a single call for improved usability.

- The `has_units` input parameter, which specifies whether the third line of `SWAT+` input or output files contains column units, is now **mandatory** across the `pySWATPlus` package (previously optional) to ensure consistent file handling.

- Added [Contributing Guidelines](https://swat-model.github.io/pySWATPlus/CONTRIBUTING) with clear instructions for setting up the development environment, reporting issues, and submitting contributions.

- Added [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/swat-model/pySWATPlus/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to define standards for a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive community.
