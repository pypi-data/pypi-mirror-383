`scores` is a Python package containing mathematical functions for the verification, evaluation and optimisation of forecasts, predictions or models. It supports labelled n-dimensional (multidimensional) data, which is used in many scientific fields and in machine learning. At present, `scores` primarily supports the geoscience communities; in particular, the meteorological, climatological and oceanographic communities.

## Overview

Below is a **curated selection** of the metrics, tools and statistical tests included in `scores`. [(Click here for the full list.)](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html)

| **[Probability](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html#probability)**        |Scores for evaluating forecasts that are expressed as predictive distributions, ensembles, and probabilities of binary events.                   |E.g. Brier Score, CRPS for CDFs and ensembles (including threshold weighted versions), and Isotonic Regression (reliability diagrams). [See all.](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html#probability)               |
| **[Categorical](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html#categorical)**       	|Scores for evaluating forecasts of categories.                	|E.g. 18 binary contingency table (confusion matrix) metrics, the FIxed Risk Multicategorical (FIRM) Score, the SEEPS score and the Risk Matrix Score. [See all.](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html#categorical)               	|
| **[Spatial](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html#spatial)** 	|Scores that take into account spatial structure.                 	|Fractions Skill Score. [See all.](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html#spatial)              	|
| **[Statistical Tests](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html#statistical-tests)** 	|Tools to conduct statistical tests and generate confidence intervals.                 	|Diebold Mariano. [See all.](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html#statistical-tests)             	|
| **[Processing Tools](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html#processing-tools-for-preparing-data)**        	|Tools to pre-process data.                 	|E.g. Data matching, Discretisation, Block Bootstrapping, and Cumulative Density Function Manipulation. [See all.](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html#processing-tools-for-preparing-data)              	|
| **[Plotting Data](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html#plotting-data)**        	|Tools to generate data for plotting.               	|ROC curves, Murphy diagrams, and Q-Q plots. [See all.](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html#plotting-data)             	|
| **[Emerging](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html#emerging)**        	|Emerging scores that are still undergoing mathematical peer review. They may change in line with the peer review process.                 	| *Note - the Risk Matrix Score has recently been moved to 'categorical' following peer-reviewed publication*.            	|

`scores` not only includes common scores (e.g., MAE, RMSE), it also includes novel scores not commonly found elsewhere (e.g., FIRM, Flip-Flop Index), complex scores (e.g., threshold weighted CRPS), and statistical tests (e.g., the Diebold Mariano test). Additionally, it provides pre-processing tools for preparing data for scores in a variety of formats including cumulative distribution functions (CDF). `scores` provides its own implementations where relevant to avoid extensive dependencies.

`scores` primarily supports xarray datatypes for Earth system data allowing it to work with NetCDF4, HDF5, Zarr and GRIB data formats among others. `scores` uses Dask for scaling and performance. Some metrics work with pandas and we aim to expand this capability.

All of the scores and metrics in this package have undergone a thorough scientific and software review. Every score has a companion Jupyter Notebook tutorial that demonstrates its use in practice.

## Installation

The [installation guide](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) describes four different use cases for installing, using and working with this package.

**Most users currently want the *all* installation option.** This includes the mathematical functions (scores, metrics, statistical tests etc.), the tutorial dependencies and development libraries.

```bash
# From a local checkout of the Git repository
pip install -e ".[all]"
```
**To install the mathematical functions ONLY** (no tutorial dependencies, no developer libraries), use the default *minimal* installation option. *minimal* is a stable version with limited dependencies. This can be installed from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/scores/) or with [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/scores).

```bash
# From PyPI
pip install scores
```
```bash
# From conda-forge
conda install conda-forge::scores
```
(Note: at present, only the *minimal* installation option is available from conda. In time, we intend to add more installation options to conda.)

## Using `scores`

Here is a short example of the use of `scores`:

```py
> import scores
> forecast = scores.sample_data.simple_forecast()
> observed = scores.sample_data.simple_observations()
> mean_absolute_error = scores.continuous.mae(forecast, observed)
> print(mean_absolute_error)
<xarray.DataArray ()>
array(2.)
```
[Jupyter Notebook tutorials](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/Tutorial_Gallery.html) are provided for each metric and statistical test in `scores`, as well as for some of the key features of `scores` (e.g., [dimension handling](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/Dimension_Handling.html) and [weighting results](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/Weighting_Results.html)).

## Finding, Downloading and Working With Data

All metrics, statistical techniques and data processing tools in `scores` work with [xarray](https://xarray.dev). [Some metrics](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/included.html#pandas) work with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). As such, `scores` works with any data source for which xarray or pandas can be used. See the [data sources](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/data.html) page and [this tutorial](https://scores.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/First_Data_Fetching.html) for more information on finding, downloading and working with different sources of data.
