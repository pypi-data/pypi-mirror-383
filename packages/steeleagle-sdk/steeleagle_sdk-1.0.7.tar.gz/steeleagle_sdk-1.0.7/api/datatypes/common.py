class ResponseStatus(int, Enum):
    """Response types for RPC functions.

        Values 0-2 (`OK`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED`) are specific to the SteelEagle protocol.
        They determine what phase an RPC call is in: `OK` -> ack, `IN_PROGRESS` -> in progress,
        and `COMPLETED` -> completed. These intermediate phases are generally not exposed to
        user-facing code and are only used for streaming methods. In contrast to normal gRPC
        procedure, a call is only considered complete on a response of `COMPLETED` instead of `OK`.
        If an error occurs, SteelEagle defers to gRPC error codes, 3-18. More details on these codes
        can be found ![here](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_statuscodes.html). Note that
        the value of these codes is offset by 2 from their original form (e.g. `CANCELLED` = 3 vs = 1).
        Therefore, for error codes, the transformation from gRPC to SteelEagle response code is to add
        2 to the code. The only codes that differ from their gRPC meaning are codes 9 and 18.

    Attributes:
        OK (0): command acknowledged
        IN_PROGRESS (1): command in progress
        COMPLETED (2): command finished without error
        CANCELLED (3): the operation was cancelled, typically by the caller
        UNKNOWN (4): unknown error
        INVALID_ARGUMENT (5): the client specified an invalid argument
        DEADLINE_EXCEEDED (6): the deadline expired before the operation could complete
        NOT_FOUND (7): some requested entity was not found
        ALREADY_EXISTS (8): an entity the client attempted to create already exists
        PERMISSION_DENIED (9): the provided identity is not permitted to execute this operation by the current law (unique to SteelEagle)
        RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED (10): some resource has been exhausted
        FAILED_PRECONDITION (11): the operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution
        ABORTED (12): the operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort
        OUT_OF_RANGE (13): the operation was attempted past the valid range
        UNIMPLEMENTED (14): the operation is not implemented/supported by the service
        INTERNAL (15): an internal error occured while executing the operation
        UNAVAILABLE (16): the service is currently unavailable
        DATA_LOSS (17): unrecoverable data loss or corruption
        UNAUTHENTICATED (18): the client failed to provide an identity (unique to SteelEagle)
