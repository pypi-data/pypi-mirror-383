# Notes:
# 1) Initial consonants are prefixes while both vowels and final consonants are suffixes in pinyin writing. For example, NǏHǍO, N- and H- are prefixes while -I and -AO are suffixes.
# 2) -Ê with a hat (e-circumflex) is not used in everyday life pinyin writing because it stands for the sound /e/ like E in RED, which is only present in the suffix -EI with no hat (-ÊI is always replaced by -EI that has been taken off the diacritic by rule).
# 3) -NG handshape won't be signed if -ANG, -IANG, -UANG, ..., or -ENG handshape appears.
# 4) -Ê and -NG might be there for linguistic reasons but not for everyday life using.
# 5) Usually, pinyin places a tonal mark above a vowel in a monosyllable, but in CSL, the tonal mark handshapes are always signed at the end of their syllables. For example, NǏHǍO will be signed N-I-TONE3 H-AO-TONE3.
# 6) Any suffixes other than E that are followed by R, e.g., -AR, -ENR, -IAR; -UANGR, are equivalent to those suffixes followed by -ER. For example, the word HÁIR will be signed H-AI-ER-TONE2 or the word NIǍOR will be signed N-IAO-ER-TONE3.
# 7) Please request more info from a CSL signer about the pinyin's rules in CSL fingerspelling. Maybe the Pinyin Input Method should also be included for the consideration.
