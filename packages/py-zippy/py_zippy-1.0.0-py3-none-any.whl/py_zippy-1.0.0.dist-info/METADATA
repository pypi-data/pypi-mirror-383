# Zippy

**Multi-purpose archive extraction, repair and brute-force toolkit.**

</div>

![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/zippy-toolkit?color=blue&logo=pypi&style=flat-square) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/zippy-toolkit?color=blue&logo=python&style=flat-square) ![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/zippy-toolkit?color=blue&logo=apache&style=flat-square) ![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/John0n1/ZIPPY/ci.yml?branch=main&label=build&logo=github&style=flat-square) ![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/John0n1/ZIPPY/main?logo=codecov&style=flat-square)

```bash

- **Broad format coverage** - (`tar`, `tar.gz`, `tar.bz2`, `tar.xz`, `tar.lzma`), (`gzip`, `bz2`, `xz`, `lzma`), `7z`, `rar`, `zstd` and ZIP family (including APK/JAR/WAR/IPA/EAR).
- **Consistent UX** - consistent logging, progress indicators, and tab completion for every command.
- **Security tooling** - create or re-lock encrypted ZIPs, run smart dictionary attacks with the bundled password list, and capture verbose traces when needed.
- **Integrity & repair** - repair, attempt salvage extractions, and perform best-effort recovery for TAR and single-file formats. It grabs whatever it can, even if files look broken or corrupted. This is achieved by scanning the archive for valid headers and footers, and extracting the data in between, then rebuilding the file structure using advanced data pointers and heuristics.

## Installation

### From PyPI (recommended)

```bash
python -m pip install zippy
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/John0n1/ZIPPY.git
cd ZIPPY
python -m pip install .

### Debian package

```bash
sudo apt install ./zippy_*.deb
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Extract an archive
zippy --extract backups/site.tar.xz -o ./site

# Create a password-protected ZIP from multiple paths
zippy --lock secure.zip -f docs,images -p "Tru5ted!"

# List TAR.BZ2 contents
zippy --list datasets.tar.bz2

# Attempt unlocking with the bundled wordlist
zippy --unlock encrypted.zip -d password_list.txt --verbose

# Run salvage repair on a damaged tarball
zippy --repair broken.tar.gz --repair-mode remove_corrupted
```

Run `zippy --help` for the full command reference or `zippy --version` to confirm the installed release.

## Supported archive formats

| Family | Types |
| ------ | ----- |
| ZIP | `zip` (with optional password protection) |
| TAR | `tar`, `tar.gz`, `tar.bz2`, `tar.xz`, `tar.lzma`, `.tgz`, `.tbz`, `.txz`, `.tlz` |
| Single-file | `gzip` (`.gz`), `bz2` (`.bz2`), `xz` (`.xz`), `lzma` (`.lzma`) |

Unsupported formats (e.g. 7z, rar, zstd) will raise a friendly error instructing you to choose a supported type.

## Configuration & automation

- Use `--save-config <file>` to capture the current flag set (including passwords or dictionary paths if provided).
- Rehydrate saved flags via `--load-config <file>` for repeatable batch jobs.
- Disable animations with `--no-animation` for CI environments.

## Logging & colours

Logging defaults to concise `INFO` output. Add `--verbose` for `DEBUG` traces. Colour output automatically downgrades in non-interactive terminals, while animations fall back to plain log messages when disabled or redirected. Windows terminals are supported through `colorama`.

## Password dictionary

The bundled `password_list.txt` contains hundreds of common credentials, curated for demonstration purposes. The unlock command trims duplicates, ignores comments (`# ...`), and safely handles mixed encodings. Supply your own list with `--dictionary <file>` for larger attacks.
