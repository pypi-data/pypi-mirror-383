        Generate a response based on the provided prompts and tools.

        Args:
            system_prompt (str | None, optional):
                The system prompt to guide the model's behavior.
            user_prompt (str | None, optional):
                The user prompt containing the main input.
            tools (list[dict[str, Any]] | None, optional):
                A list of tools that the model can use
                to enhance its response.
            tool_choice (str | dict[str, str], optional):
                Strategy for selecting tools.
                Can be "auto" for automatic selection,
                "required" for using at least one tool,
                or a specific tool.
            max_attempts (int, optional):
                The maximum number of attempts to make before giving up.
                Defaults to 1.

            tuple[str, Any]:
                A tuple containing the generated response text
                and tool call outputs (if any).

        Raises:
            ExternalServiceAPIError:
                Errors from the underlying embedding API.
            ValueError:
