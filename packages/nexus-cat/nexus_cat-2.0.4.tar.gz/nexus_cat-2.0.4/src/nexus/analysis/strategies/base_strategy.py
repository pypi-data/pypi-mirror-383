    Abstract base class for all clustering strategies.

    A clustering strategy defines a specific algorithm for grouping nodes into
    clusters based on a set of criterion. This class provides the fundamental
    interface for all strategies, including a common union-find implementation
    for efficient cluster merging.

    Each concrete strategy must implement the `build_clusters` method, which
    contains the core logic for identifying and forming the clusters.

    Attributes:
        frame (Frame): The simulation frame containing the nodes to be clustered.
        _nodes (List[Node]): A direct reference to the list of nodes in the frame.
        _settings (Settings): The application settings object, providing access to clustering parameters.
