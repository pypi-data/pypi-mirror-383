Importers
=========

The importers normally all work very well together with `Smart Importer <https://github.com/beancount/smart_importer/>`__
and are also usable in `Fava <https://github.com/beancount/fava/>`__.

Bitstamp
--------

Import transactions from `Bitstamp <https://www.bitstamp.com/>`__

Create a file called (or ending with) bitstamp.yaml in your import location (e.g. downloads folder).

.. code-block:: yaml

  username: "12345"
  key: "MyKey"
  secret: "MySecret"
  account: 'Assets:Bitstamp'
  otherExpensesAccount: 'Expenses:Fee'
  capGainAccount: 'Income:Capitalgain'
  monthCutoff: 3
  currencies:
    - eur
    - btc

.. code-block:: python

  from tariochbctools.importers.bitst import importer as bitstimp

  CONFIG = [bitstimp.Importer()]


QuickFile
--------------
Import from `QuickFile <https://www.quickfile.co.uk/>`__ using their API services.
Supports a `range of (mostly UK) banks <https://www.quickfile.co.uk/openbanking/providers>`__.

Requires a QuickFile account (any pricing plan, including free) but with a paid
Automated Bank Feed subscription (`small annual fee <https://www.quickfile.co.uk/home/pricing>`__).

It is assumed you already have automated bank feeds configured within QuickFile
for the accounts of interest and are able to browse transactions within the QuickFile dashboard.

.. code-block:: python

  from tariochbctools.importers.quickfile import importer as qfimp

  CONFIG = [qfimp.Importer()]

Create a file called ``quickfile.yaml`` in your import location (e.g. download folder).

.. code-block:: yaml

  account_number: "YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER"
  api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
  app_id: YOUR_APP_ID
  from_date: 2020-12-13
  to_date: 2020-12-20
  accounts:
      1200: Assets:Other
      1201: Assets:Savings
  transaction_count: 200

from_date and to_date are both optional

To obtain an API key you must create an app in the `Account Settings | 3rd
Party Integration | API` section of your account dashboard.

The only permissions it needs to have is "Invoices.Bank_Search"

your api_key is for your account, you can find it on "Settings - My Apps" or in the quickfile sandbox

Accounts are indexed in the config by their ``nominal code`` (typically: ~1200)
visible in each account's settings. Only accounts listed in the config will be
queried.


Revolut
-------

Import CSV from `Revolut <https://www.revolut.com/>`__

.. code-block:: python

  from tariochbctools.importers.revolut import importer as revolutimp

  CONFIG = [revolutimp.Importer("/Revolut-CHF.*\.csv", "Assets:Revolut:CHF", "CHF")]


Wise (formerly Transferwise)
----------------------------

Import from `Wise <https://www.wise.com/>`__ using their api.

First, generate a personal API token by logging on and going to settings.
Next, you need to generate a public/private key pair and then upload the public
key part to your account. To generate the keys, execute (e.g. in your ``.ssh`` folder)

.. code-block:: bash

   openssl genrsa -out wise.pem
   openssl rsa -pubout -in wise.pem -out wise_public.pem
   openssl pkey -in wise.pem -traditional > wise_traditional.pem

The final command makes a traditional private key for compatibility with the python rsa library. This may stop being necessary at some point. See `this page https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/80` for details.

Now upload the *public* key part to your Wise account.

You can then create an import config for beancount, or add Wise to your existing one.

.. code-block:: python

  from tariochbctools.importers.transferwise import importer as twimp

  CONFIG = [twimp.Importer()]

Create a file called (or ending with) transferwise.yaml in your import location (e.g. download folder).

.. code-block:: yaml

  token: <your api token>
  baseAccount: <Assets:Transferwise:>
  privateKeyPath: /path/to/wise_traditional.pem


Optionally, you can provide a dictionary of account names mapped by currency. In this case
you must provide a name for every currency in your Wise account, otherwise the import will
fail.


.. code-block:: yaml

  token: <your api token>
  baseAccount:
    SEK: "Assets:MySwedishWiseAccount"
    GBP: "Assets:MyUKWiseAccount"
  privateKeyPath: /path/to/wise_traditional.pem

TrueLayer
---------

Import from `TrueLayer <https://www.truelayer.com/>`__ using their api services. e.g. supports Revolut.
You need to create a dev account and see their documentation about how to get a refresh token.

.. code-block:: python

  from tariochbctools.importers.truelayer import importer as tlimp

  CONFIG = [tlimp.Importer()]

Create a file called (or ending with) truelayer.yaml in your import location (e.g. download folder).

.. code-block:: yaml

  account: <Assets:MyBank>
  client_id: <CLIENT ID>
  client_secret: <CLIENT SECRET>
  refresh_token: <REFRESH TOKEN>

Instead of a single ``account``, the configuration may include a *mapping* from
TrueLayer account IDs to beancount accounts. e.g.:

.. code-block:: yaml

  accounts:
    1aacb3110398ec5a2334fb0ffc2fface: Assets:Revolut:GBP
    ec34db160c61d468dc1cedde8bedb1f1: Liabilities:Visa

If it is present, transactions for *only these accounts* will be imported.


GoCardless (formerly Nordigen)
------------------------------

Import from `GoCardless <https://gocardless.com/bank-account-data/>`__ (formerly known as `Nordigen <https://gocardless.com/en-us/g/gc-nordigen/>`__) using their api services. Supports `2500+ banks <https://gocardless.com/bank-account-data/coverage/>`__ in Europe and the UK including e.g. Revolut.
You need to create a free account and create a token. I've included a small cli to allow to hook up
to different banks with GoCardless. If you're country is not supported you can play around with other countries
e.g. CH is not allowed but things like revolut still work. You can also create multiple links and they will
all be listed in the end.

.. code-block:: console

  nordigen-conf list_banks --secret_id YOURSECRET_ID --secret_key YOURSECRET_KEY --country DE
  nordigen-conf create_link --secret_id YOURSECRET_ID --secret_key YOURSECRET_KEY --bank REVOLUT_REVOGB21 --reference myref --max_historical_days 90 --access_valid_for_days 90 --access_scope "[\"balances\", \"details\", \"transactions\"]"
  nordigen-conf list_accounts --secret_id YOURSECRET_ID --secret_key YOURSECRET_KEY
  nordigen-conf delete_link --secret_id YOURSECRET_ID --secret_key YOURSECRET_KEY --reference myref


.. code-block:: python

  from tariochbctools.importers.nordigen import importer as nordimp

  CONFIG = [nordimp.Importer()]

Create a file called (or ending with) nordigen.yaml in your import location (e.g. download folder).

    - id: <ACCOUNT-ID>
      asset_account: "Assets:MyAccount:CHF"

AwardWallet
------------------------------

Import from `AwardWallet <https://awardwallet.com/>`__ using their `Account
Access API <https://awardwallet.com/api/account>`__.

As of 2025 AwardWallet integrates over 460 airline, hotel, shopping and other
loyalty programmes. Many programmes do not support retrieval of transactions,
only balances.

1.  Update your personal AwardWallet account.
    The importer can only retrieve data that has already been synced to your AwardWallet account.

2.  Follow the instructions in the `API documentation
    <https://awardwallet.com/api/account#introduction>`__ to register for a
    free Business account and create an API key.

    The API key is restricted to the **allowed IP addresses** you specify in
    the Business interface API Settings.

3.  Link and authorize personal accounts using the included ``awardwallet-conf``
    CLI tool:

    .. code-block:: console

      awardwallet-conf --api-key YOUR_API_KEY get_link_url

    Manage access to your personal account under `Manage Users
    <https://awardwallet.com/user/connections>`__ in the personal web
    interface.

4.  Generate a config file for all linked users ending with
    ``awardwallet.yaml`` in your import location (e.g. download folder) and
    edit it to your needs.

    .. code-block:: console

      awardwallet-conf --api-key YOUR_API_KEY generate > awardwallet.yaml

    If you have multiple accounts using the same points currency (e.g. ``AVIOS``
    used by BA, Iberia, ...) create sub-accounts for each so that ``balance``
    directives will work.

    Example configuration file:

    .. code-block:: yaml

      api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
      users:
        12345:
          name: John Smith
          all_history: false     # only the last 10 txns per account
          accounts:
            7654321:
              provider: "British Airways Club"
              account: Assets:Current:Points
              currency: AVIOS

5.  Finally, initialize the importer:

    .. code-block:: python

      from tariochbctools.importers.awardwalletimp import importer as awimp

      CONFIG = [awimp.Importer()]
