#+title: Hugo auto weight ineffective for per-file exports
#+author:

#+hugo_base_dir: ../../
#+hugo_weight: auto
#+hugo_tags: weight ineffective

Even though we have =#+hugo_weight: auto= in this file, the weight
will be treated as nil as this file is exported using the /file-based/
export.

The auto-weight calculation works *only* for /per-subtree/ flow.
