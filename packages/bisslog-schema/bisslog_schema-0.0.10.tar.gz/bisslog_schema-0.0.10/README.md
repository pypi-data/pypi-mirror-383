**bisslog-schema-py** is a lightweight framework to organize and document the key elements of a distributed system, focusing on its use cases and service design.  
It structures the metadata without exposing any underlying technical or implementation-specific details.
The goal is to design and document a distributed system from a service-centric perspective, emphasizing business use cases and their criticality, while remaining technology-agnostic.


## ðŸš€ Installation
You can install `bisslog-schema` using **pip**:

```bash
pip install bisslog_schema
```

For YAML support, you may also need to install `PyYAML`:

```bash 
pip install bisslog_schema[yaml]
```

or 

```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

## Example YAML for Service Definition

Here is an example of how to define a service and its use cases using YAML:

~~~yaml
---
name: "webhook receiver"
type: "microservice"
description: "Receives events from external platforms and converts them into company events for internal processing"
service_type: "functional"
team: "code-infrastructure"
tags:
  service: "webhook-receptor"

use_cases:
  addEventAdmitted:
    name: "add event type admitted to platform"
    description: "Updates adding event type admitted to platform if not exists, otherwise updates"
    triggers:
      - type: "http"
        options:
          route: "/webhook/event-type-admitted/{uid}"
          apigw: "internal"
          authenticator: "employee"
          method: "post"
          mapper:
            path_query.uid: uid
            body: data
            headers.user: creator
    external_interactions:
        - keyname: "marketing_division"
          type_interaction: "database"
          operation: "get_last_sales_from_client"
  # More use cases...
~~~

Note: The criticality field can use either named levels (e.g., "high") or direct numeric values (e.g., 90).

## ðŸ”§ CLI Usage

Validate metadata files through the command line, ensuring they conform to the expected schema.

```yaml
bisslog_schema analyze_metadata service.yaml --format-file yaml
```

### Options
- `--path`: Specify the path to the metadata file. If not provided, it will search in the default locations.
- `--format-file`: Specify the format of the metadata file. Supported formats are `yaml` and `json`. Default is `yaml`.
- `--encoding`: File encoding (default: utf-8)
- `--min-warnings`: Minimum warning percentage (optional)


---

## ðŸ’» Loading Service Metadata

You can load service definitions from YAML or JSON files using the `read_service_metadata` function.  
It automatically searches for metadata files in predefined locations if a path is not provided.

You can specify the path to the metadata file as an argument or as an environment variable in `SERVICE_METADATA_PATH`.

### Example

```python
from bisslog_schema import read_service_metadata

service_info = read_service_metadata()
print(service_info.name)
for use_case_keyname, use_case in service_info.use_cases.items():
    print(f"{use_case.keyname}: {use_case.name}")
```

## Main Concepts

### ServiceInfo

The `ServiceInfo` class models a service in the system.  
Each service can define:

- `name`: Service name
- `description`: Brief explanation of the service's responsibility
- `type`: Logical category (e.g., "microservice", "library")
- `service_type`: Service type (e.g., "functional", "technical")
- `team`: Responsible team
- `tags`: Arbitrary metadata tags for classification
- `use_cases`: List of `UseCaseInfo` objects representing the service's use cases

Service metadata can be loaded dynamically from external YAML or JSON files.

**Service Definition Example:**

The following example illustrates a service definition with its use cases and external interactions:

![service-definition-example-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darwinhc/bisslog-schema-py/master/docs/assets/bisslog-schema-service-example-image.jpg)


This is the YAML representation of the service definition:
```yaml
---
name: "user management"
type: "microservice"
description: "Handles creation, update, and retrieval of user accounts in the system"
service_type: "functional"
team: "identity-platform"
tags:
  service: "user-management"

use_cases:
  registerUser:
    name: "register user"
    description: "Registers or creates a new user in the system"
    actor: "end user"
    criticality: "high"
    type: "create functional data"
    triggers:
      - type: "http"
        options:
          route: "/user"
          method: "post"
          apigw: "customer-public"
          mapper:
            body: user_data
    external_interactions:
      - keyname: users_division
        type_interaction: "database"
        operation: "create_user"
    tags:
      accessibility: "public"

```


---

### UseCaseInfo

The `UseCaseInfo` class represents a use case belonging to a service, with the following fields:

- `keyname`: Unique identifier for the use case.
- `name`: Human-readable name.
- `description`: A detailed description of what the use case does.
- `actor`: The entity (user, system, platform) that initiates the use case.
- `type`: Logical operation type (e.g., "create", "read", "update", "delete").
- `criticality`: Business importance of the use case, represented as a `CriticalityEnum`.
- `tags`: Metadata tags for further classification.
- `triggers`: List of `TriggerInfo` entries defining how the use case is triggered.
- `external_interactions`: List of `ExternalInteraction` Represents any external systems or APIs this use case depends on or interacts with.

---

### TriggerInfo and TriggerOptions

Triggers define how a use case is initiated.  
Available trigger types (enumerated by `TriggerEnum`) include:

- `HTTP`: HTTP request initiation.
- `WebSocket`: WebSocket-based interaction.
- `Consumer`: Event-driven trigger (e.g., queues).
- `Schedule`: Time-based scheduled triggers.

Each trigger may have associated options (e.g., route, method, authenticator).

---

### ExternalInteraction

### ExternalInteraction

The `ExternalInteraction` class represents an external interaction in the system, such as database access or external service calls.

- `keyname`: Unique identifier for the interaction. For example, `marketing_division`.
- `type_interaction`: String representing the type of interaction (optional). For example, `database`.
- `operation`: Specific operation or action being performed (optional). For example, `get_last_sales_from_client`.
- `type_interaction_standard`: Standardized type of interaction resolved from `type_interaction` using aliases (optional).


**Example of External Interaction:**

![external-interaction-example-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darwinhc/bisslog-schema-py/master/docs/assets/bisslog-schema-external-interaction-image.jpg)

```yaml
use_cases:
  addEventAdmitted:
    external_interactions:
        - keyname: "marketing_division"
          type_interaction: "database"
          operation: "get_last_sales_from_client"
```

---

### CriticalityEnum

`CriticalityEnum` provides a standardized set of criticality levels for use cases:

| Level      | Value |
|------------|-------|
| NONE       | 0     |
| VERY_LOW   | 10    |
| LOW        | 20    |
| MEDIUM     | 50    |
| HIGH       | 70    |
| VERY_HIGH  | 90    |
| CRITICAL   | 100   |

This scale helps prioritize use cases based on their business or operational impact.
