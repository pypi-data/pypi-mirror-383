### Quick Template

```python
from markitdown_chunker import MarkitDownProcessor

# Create processor
processor = MarkitDownProcessor(
    chunk_size=1000,
    chunk_overlap=200
)

# Process your document
result = processor.process(
    file_path="your_document.pdf",
    output_dir="output/"
)

print(f"Processed successfully!")
print(f"Created {len(result['chunking']['chunks'])} chunks")
```
