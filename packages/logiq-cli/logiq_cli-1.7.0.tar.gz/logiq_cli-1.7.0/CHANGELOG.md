## [1.5.0] - 2025-01-12

### Added
- **Real-time CLI Status Updates**: CLI tool now properly updates user status to active/inactive on the frontend dashboard
- **Enhanced Authentication Flow**: Improved credential loading and username configuration for better status tracking
- **Automatic Status Management**: CLI status automatically updates when monitoring starts and stops
- **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for authentication and status update failures

### Fixed

- **Authentication Persistence**: More reliable authentication state management across CLI sessions
- **Status Synchronization**: Improved synchronization between CLI tool and server for user status

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced `_load_stored_token()` method to properly set username in config
- Improved `_load_credentials()` method for better credential management
- Added comprehensive status update calls in all monitoring KeyboardInterrupt handlers
- Better error handling and logging for status update operations

## [1.4.0] - 2024-12-19

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed Pre-RAG classifier issue causing all logs to be classified as threats
- **Model Quality Check**: Added automatic detection of poor ML model performance
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Improved rule-based classification fallback when ML model fails
