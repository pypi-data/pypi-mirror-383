## What is PDM?

PDM is meant to be a next generation Python package management tool.
It was originally built for personal use. If you feel you are going well
with `Pipenv` or `Poetry` and don't want to introduce another package manager,
just stick to it. But if you are missing something that is not present in those tools,
you can probably find some goodness in `pdm`.

## Highlights of features

- Simple and fast dependency resolver, mainly for large binary distributions.
- A [PEP 517] build backend.
- [PEP 621] project metadata.
- Flexible and powerful plug-in system.
- Versatile user scripts.
- Install Pythons using [indygreg's python-build-standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone).
- Opt-in centralized installation cache like [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/motivation#saving-disk-space-and-boosting-installation-speed).

[pep 517]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517
[pep 621]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621
[pnpm]: https://pnpm.io/motivation#saving-disk-space-and-boosting-installation-speed

## Comparisons to other alternatives

### [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io)

Pipenv is a dependency manager that combines `pip` and `venv`, as the name implies.
It can install packages from a non-standard `Pipfile.lock` or `Pipfile`.
However, Pipenv does not handle any packages related to packaging your code,
so it’s useful only for developing non-installable applications (Django sites, for example).
If you’re a library developer, you need `setuptools` anyway.

### [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)

Poetry manages environments and dependencies in a similar way to Pipenv,
but it can also build .whl files with your code, and it can upload wheels and source distributions to PyPI.
It has a pretty user interface and users can customize it via a plugin. Poetry uses the `pyproject.toml` standard.

### [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io)

Hatch can also manage environments, allowing multiple environments per project. By default it has a central location for all environments but it can be configured to put a project's environment(s) in the project root directory. It can manage packages but without lockfile support. It can also be used to package a project (with PEP 621 compliant pyproject.toml files) and upload it to PyPI.

### This project

PDM can manage virtual environments (venvs) in both project and centralized locations, similar to Pipenv. It reads project metadata from a standardized `pyproject.toml` file and supports lockfiles. Users can add additional functionality through plugins, which can be shared by uploading them as distributions.

Unlike Poetry and Hatch, PDM is not limited to a specific build backend; users have the freedom to choose any build backend they prefer.

## Installation

<a href="https://repology.org/project/pdm/versions">
    <img src="https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/pdm.svg" alt="Packaging status" align="right">
</a>

PDM requires python version 3.9 or higher. Alternatively, you can download the standalone binary file from the [release assets](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/releases).

### Via Install Script

Like Pip, PDM provides an installation script that will install PDM into an isolated environment.

**For Linux/Mac**

```bash
curl -sSL https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | python3 -
```

**For Windows**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | py -"
```

For security reasons, you should verify the checksum of `install-pdm.py`.
It can be downloaded from [install-pdm.py.sha256](https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py.sha256).

The installer will install PDM into the user site and the location depends on the system:

- `$HOME/.local/bin` for Linux
- `$HOME/Library/Python/<version>/bin` for MacOS
- `%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts` on Windows

You can pass additional options to the script to control how PDM is installed:

```
usage: install-pdm.py [-h] [-v VERSION] [--prerelease] [--remove] [-p PATH] [-d DEP]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v VERSION, --version VERSION | envvar: PDM_VERSION
                        Specify the version to be installed, or HEAD to install from the main branch
  --prerelease | envvar: PDM_PRERELEASE    Allow prereleases to be installed
  --remove | envvar: PDM_REMOVE            Remove the PDM installation
  -p PATH, --path PATH | envvar: PDM_HOME  Specify the location to install PDM
  -d DEP, --dep DEP | envvar: PDM_DEPS     Specify additional dependencies, can be given multiple times
```

You can either pass the options after the script or set the env var value.

### Alternative Installation Methods

If you are on macOS and using `homebrew`, install it by:

```bash
brew install pdm
```

If you are on Windows and using [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), install it by:

```
scoop bucket add frostming https://github.com/frostming/scoop-frostming.git
scoop install pdm
```

Otherwise, it is recommended to install `pdm` in an isolated environment with `pipx`:

```bash
pipx install pdm
```

Or you can install it under a user site:

```bash
pip install --user pdm
```

With [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/)

```bash
asdf plugin add pdm
asdf install pdm latest
```

## Quickstart

**Create a new PDM project**

```bash
pdm new my-project
```

Answer the questions following the guide, and a PDM project with a `pyproject.toml` file will be ready to use.

**Install dependencies**

```bash
pdm add requests flask
```

You can add multiple dependencies in the same command. After a while, check the `pdm.lock` file to see what is locked for each package.
