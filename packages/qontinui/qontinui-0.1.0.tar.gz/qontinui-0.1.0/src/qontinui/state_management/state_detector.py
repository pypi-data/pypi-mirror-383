class StateDetector:
    """Discovers active states through visual pattern matching.

    Port of StateDetector from Qontinui framework class.

    StateDetector provides mechanisms to identify which states are currently active in the GUI
    by searching for their associated visual patterns. This is essential for recovering from
    lost context, initializing automation, or maintaining awareness of the current application
    state during long-running automation sessions.

    Key operations:
    - Check Active States: Verify if currently tracked states are still active
    - Rebuild Active States: Full discovery when context is lost
    - Search All States: Comprehensive scan of all defined states
    - Find Specific State: Check if a particular state is active
    - Refresh States: Complete reset and rediscovery

    Performance considerations:
    - Full state search is computationally expensive (O(n) with n = total images)
    - Checking existing active states is more efficient than full search
    - Future optimization could use machine learning for instant state recognition
    - Static images in states make ML training data generation feasible

    State discovery strategy:
    1. First checks if known active states are still visible
    2. If no active states remain, performs comprehensive search
    3. Falls back to UNKNOWN state if no states are found
    4. Updates StateMemory with discovered active states

    Common use cases:
    - Initializing automation when starting state is unknown
    - Recovering after application crashes or unexpected navigation
    - Periodic state validation in long-running automation
    - Debugging state detection issues

    Future enhancements:
    - Neural network-based instant state recognition from screenshots
    - Probabilistic state detection based on partial matches
    - Hierarchical search starting with likely states
    - Caching and optimization for frequently checked states

    In the model-based approach, StateDetector serves as the sensory system that connects
    the abstract state model to the concrete visual reality of the GUI. It enables the
    framework to maintain situational awareness and recover gracefully from unexpected
    situations, which is crucial for robust automation.
