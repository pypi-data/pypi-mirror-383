class TaskSequence:
    """Represents an ordered list of automation steps.

    Port of TaskSequence from Qontinui framework class.

    TaskSequence is used to define a series of automation actions that should
    be executed in order. This is a core concept in the DSL that allows
    complex automation workflows to be defined declaratively.

    Built internally by ActionSequenceBuilder in the fluent API or
    defined directly in JSON.

    Example in JSON:
        {
            "steps": [
                {
                    "actionOptions": {"action": "FIND"},
                    "objectCollection": {"stateImages": [{"name": "loginButton"}]}
                },
                {
                    "actionOptions": {"action": "CLICK"},
                    "objectCollection": {"stateImages": [{"name": "loginButton"}]}
                }
            ]
