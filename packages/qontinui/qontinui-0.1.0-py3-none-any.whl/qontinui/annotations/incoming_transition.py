    """Marks a method as an IncomingTransition.

    An IncomingTransition (arrival/finish transition) verifies that we have
    successfully arrived at the target state (incoming to that state).

    The annotated method should:
    - Return boolean (true if state is confirmed, false otherwise)
    - Verify the presence of unique elements that confirm the state is active
    - Be a member of a class annotated with @transition_set
    - There should be only ONE @incoming_transition method per @transition_set class

    This transition is executed after any OutgoingTransition to confirm successful
    navigation to the target state, regardless of which state we came from.

    Example usage:
        @incoming_transition
        def verify_arrival(self) -> bool:
            logger.info("Verifying arrival at Pricing state (incoming transition)")
            return self.action.find(self.pricing_state.start_for_free_button).is_success()

    Args:
        description: Optional description of this arrival verification.
                    Useful for documentation and debugging.
        timeout: Timeout for verifying arrival in seconds. Default is 5 seconds.
        required: Whether this verification is required for the transition
                 to be considered successful. If false, failure of this
                 verification will log a warning but not fail the transition.
                 Default is True.
