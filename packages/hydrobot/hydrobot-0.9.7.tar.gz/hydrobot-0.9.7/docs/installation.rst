============


Stable release
--------------

To install Hydrobot, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install hydrobot

This is the preferred method to install Hydrobot, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
