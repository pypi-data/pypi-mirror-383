~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hydro Processing Tools could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official Hydro Processing Tools docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/nicmostert/hydrobot/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `hydrobot` for local development.

1. Fork the `hydrobot` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/hydrobot.git

3. Install your local copy into a venv. This is how you set up your fork for local development

Switch to the newly created root directory of the project::

    $ cd hydrobot/

Create a virtual environment for this project::

    $ python -m venv path/to/venv/location/

Activate the virtual environment:

Unix::

    $ source path/to/venv/location/bin/activate

Windows (Powershell)::

    $ ./path/to/venv/location/Scripts/Activate.ps1

Windows (cmd)::

    $ ./path/to/venv/location/Scripts/activate.bat

Once within the venv, install the required packages for development::

    $ python -m pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

Finally, install the hydrobot in "editable" (or "develop") mode.
This allows you to import the package into test scripts and prototypes, while allowing you to edit the package in-place without reinstallation.::

    $ python -m pip install -e .

4. Create a branch for local development

In order to track local changes, you must create a branch for local development.
This command creates a local brach, then switches to that branch.::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

Now you can make your changes locally.

   *NOTE: It is good practice to give your branch a name based on the changes you are planning to make. E.g. "adding-signal-processing-feature" or "fixing-bug-in-spike-filter".*

5. When you're done making changes, verify that all tests still pass on your branch::

    $ pytest

Your branch will not be allowed to merge if all tests do not pass. [*NOTE: This is not technically true yet, but it will be once I figure it out.*]

6. When you're done making changes, commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."

This project makes use of various pre-commit hooks. Importantly, this code-base conforms to `black` formatting.
If your test fails, follow the instructions on how to fix any problems, and then repeat the commit command. In some cases, the pre-commit hooks will automatically fix all problems. In such cases, the changes need to be staged with `git add .` again then commit again. Since the failed commit didn't go through, feel free to use the same commit message as before.

To run all the pre-commit hooks without making a commit (e.g. to check if the auto-fixes solved all the problems), you can run::

    $ pre-commit run --all-files

When all checks pass and your changes are committed sucessfully, you may push your changes to the remote version of your branch::

    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website. Provide a detailed description of the changes you have made to ensure that they can be merged efficiently.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the appropriate location in the documentation.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

$ pytest tests.test_hydrobot


Releasing to PyPI
------------------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.

1. Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst, documentation, etc.).

2. Confirm the repo is an a good state::

    $ pre-commit run --all-files
    $ pytest

3. Then run `bump-my-version` to increment the release tags in the appropriate places. Consider using the `--dry-run`
flag to make sure there are no errors first. bump-my-version has a dependency on a modern version of pydantic (and
hilltop-py requires an older version) so bump-my-version needs to be installed fresh (don't pip freeze after)::

    $ pip install bump-my-version
    $ bump-my-version bump -v --dry-run patch # Optional, just to test if it runs without errors
    $ bump-my-version bump patch # For real this time. Possible values: major / minor / patch

4. Install the local development version of the package (make sure you're in the package root directory where
pyproject.toml is). You should see the package install with the correct version number::

    $ pip install -e .[all]

5. Run the tests to see that they still work with this local install::

    $ pytest

6. Push the commit::

    $ git push

7. Push the tags to GitHub. (Note that we don't actually release on GitHub though. We want to keep the releases to
PyPI so there's less ambiguity about how to install it.)::

    $ git push --tags

8. Do the release.

    * If using the Makefile (i.e. you have `make` installed and can run `make help` without errors) you can simply run::

        $ make release

    * Otherwise, you would have to do the release manually.

        a. Clean up all the artifact files::

            $ rm -fr build/
            $ rm -fr dist/
            $ rm -fr .eggs/
            $ find . -name '*.egg-info' -exec rm -fr {} +
            $ find . -name '*.egg' -exec rm -f {} +
            $ find . -name '*.pyc' -exec rm -f {} +
            $ find . -name '*.pyo' -exec rm -f {} +
            $ find . -name '*~' -exec rm -f {} +
            $ find . -name '__pycache__' -exec rm -fr {} +
	        $ rm -fr .pytest_cache

        b. Build the source and wheel packages::

            $ python -m build
            $ ls -l dist

        c. Use twine to release to PyPI. You'll be asked for authentication. Use the username `__token__`, along with the API key I gave you.::

            $ twine upload dist/*
