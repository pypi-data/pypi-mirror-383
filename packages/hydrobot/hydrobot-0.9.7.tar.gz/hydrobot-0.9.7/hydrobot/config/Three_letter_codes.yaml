# What all the codes we are using in hydrobot mean

# General Quality code reasons
CHK: "Base quality code: Deviation of check from logger determined this quality code"
OOV: "Out of Validation: Quality code lowered due to long period between checks"
GAP: "Missing data: No valid data for this time"
LIM: "Site quality code capped: Site has a quality code cap, additive"
SYN: "Synthetic: data is 300"
UCK: "Unchecked: data is 200"
INI: "Initial: used for start of frame"
# Measurement specific quality code reasons
CAP: "Above calibration cap: Dissolved oxygen is capped at QC500 for DO% > 100, additive"
APD: "Atmospheric pressure data: Supplemental data source AP was a lower quality"
WTD: "Water temperature data: Supplemental data source WT was a lower quality"


# Check source codes
HTP: "Site inspections, imported from hilltop"
INS: "Site Inspections, imported via R or similar process"
SOE: "State of the environment checks"
RFZ: "Rainfall zero: used for when zeroes are inserted into rainfall"
DPF: "Depth Profile: Used for lakes where measurements are made at depth"
MAN: "Manual intervention"

# Issue codes
RMT: "Rainfall manual tips issue: automatic removal of manual tips ran into problems"
LCO: "Long-term Common Offset"
MSP: "Missing supplemental parameter (rainfall)"
IRR: "Irregular data: frequency not set, some features disabled"
HXD: "Hilltop extraction data missing: inferred data type for hilltop xml"
MSD: "Missing standard data"
MQD: "Missing quality data"
MCD: "Missing check data"
