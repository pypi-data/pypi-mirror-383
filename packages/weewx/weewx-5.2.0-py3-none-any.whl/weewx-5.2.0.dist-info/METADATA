# [WeeWX](https://www.weewx.com)
*Open source software for your weather station*

## Description

The WeeWX weather system is written in Python and runs on Linux, MacOSX,
Solaris, and *BSD.  It runs exceptionally well on a Raspberry Pi.  It collects
data from many different types of weather stations and sensors, then generates
plots, HTML pages, and monthly and yearly summary reports. It can push plots,
pages, and reports to a web server, as well as upload weather-related data to 
many online weather services.  Thousands of users worldwide!

The WeeWX website has [examples](https://weewx.com/showcase.html) of
websites generated by WeeWX, and a [map](https://weewx.com/stations.html) of
stations using WeeWX.

The [hardware list](https://www.weewx.com/hardware.html) for a complete
list of supported stations, and pictures to help identify your hardware!
The [hardware comparison](https://www.weewx.com/hwcmp.html) has specifications
for many different types of hardware, including some not yet supported by
WeeWX.
