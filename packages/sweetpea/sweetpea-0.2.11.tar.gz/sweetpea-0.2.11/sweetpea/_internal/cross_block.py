    # When a derived factor has weighted levels and is in the
    # crossing, then the weight have to be handed by sampling, because
    # it doesn't work to have multiple levels in a derived factor that
    # match the same cases. If a derived factor is not in the
    # crossing, the weights are irrelevnt, because other factors
    # chosen for a combination determine a derived level.
    #
    # For a non-derived factor, weighting is effecively the same as
    # having multiple levels with the same name. Still, as long as a
    # factor with weights is used in the crossing (all of them, in the
    # case of multiple crossings), then we leave the weights in place
    # and handle them in sampling.
    #
    # But when a non-derived factor with weights is not in (all of
    # the) crossing(s), we desugar to a factor with multiple levels
    # that have the same name. That makes the biasing effect of
    # weighting work for formula-based samplers, and it geneally means
    # that samplers do not have to handle the weights specifically.
    #
    # To desugar, we create new factors and levels, and we rewrite all
    # constraints and derived factors to refer to the new ones. Each
    # desugared factor has two replacements: a non-derived factors
    # with the weights turned into multiple levels, and a derived
    # factor that has the same level names as before. The derived
    # factor is needed in case a constraint refers to an weighted
    # level that gets expanded in the non-derived factor.

    # and it maps factor to a list of two factors: the derived
    # replacement and non-derived replacement.
