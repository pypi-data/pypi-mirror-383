This property permits you to download process execution data, and you can access it from the Cloud Attachment Quota tab of Manage > Cloud Management.

         1. First create a CREATE (or POST) request to `https://api.boomi.com/api/rest/v1/<accountId>/ExecutionArtifacts` where `accountId` is the ID of the account authenticating the request.
         2. Populate the request body with the `executionId`, which is the identifier of the given run process.
         3. Send the request and either open or copy and paste the URL from the response into your web browser.
