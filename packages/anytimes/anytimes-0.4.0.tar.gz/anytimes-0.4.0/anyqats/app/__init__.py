"""Support for launching the AnyQATS GUI.

This module exposes a :func:`main` function that serves as an entry point
for the desktop application.  It delegates to :func:`anyqats.cli.launch_app`
with default arguments, allowing the GUI to be started simply by executing
``python -m anyqats.app``.

    The heavy lifting of setting up and starting the application lives in
    :func:`anyqats.cli.launch_app`.  Importing inside the function keeps import
    time light and avoids circular dependencies during package initialisation.
