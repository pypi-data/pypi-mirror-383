## About This Report

This is a demonstration of **quartoogle**, a tool for compiling Quarto documents directly to Google Drive. This report was generated dynamically using Python code, and all values you see below are computed at render time.

## Dynamic Calculations

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Calculate some metrics about quartoogle usage
total_reports = 42
reports_this_month = 7
success_rate = 98.5
avg_compile_time = 2.3
```

Here is a dynamically-generated value showing reports compiled this month: **`{python} reports_this_month`**

Here is another dynamically-generated value showing the average compile time: **`{python} f"{avg_compile_time:.1f} seconds"`**

## Usage Statistics

The table below shows key metrics about quartoogle usage rendered from a pandas DataFrame:

```{python}
from tabulate import tabulate

# Create a pandas DataFrame with usage statistics
usage_stats = pd.DataFrame({
    'Metric': [
        'Total Reports Compiled',
        'Reports This Month',
        'Success Rate'
    ],
    'Value': [
        total_reports,
        reports_this_month,
        f"{success_rate}%"
    ]
})

print(tabulate(usage_stats, headers="keys", tablefmt="github"))
```

## Compilation Times

```{python}
#| label: fig-compile-times
#| fig-cap: "Recent Compilation Times"

# Generate sample compilation times
compile_times = [2.1, 2.5, 1.9, 2.8, 2.2, 2.4, 2.0]
report_numbers = list(range(1, len(compile_times) + 1))

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4))
ax.plot(report_numbers, compile_times, marker='o', linewidth=2, markersize=6, color='#FF6B35')
ax.set_xlabel('Report Number')
ax.set_ylabel('Compile Time (seconds)')
ax.set_title('Quartoogle Compilation Performance')
ax.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.3, linestyle='--')
ax.set_ylim(0, max(compile_times) * 1.2)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

As shown in the chart above, quartoogle maintains consistent compilation times, with most reports compiling in under 3 seconds.
