# ferrmion

This codebase contains methods to generate qubit Hamiltonians from fermionic Hamiltonians.


## Encodings
- Ternary Tree encodings

    Any ternary tree can be generated by adding nodes to a tree structure, and functions exist to easily create standard encodings including: Jordan-Wigner, Parity, Bravyi-Kitaev and JKMN

- MaxNTO encodings

    A non-ternary-tree majorana string encoding with the maximal non-trivial overlap possible.
    Only works for systems with even numbers of modes (i.e. all spin-orbit Hamiltonians)


## Optimizations
