# AgentZ: Agent from Zero

**A Research-Oriented Multi-Agent System Platform**

</div>

AgentZ is a minimal, extensible codebase for multi-agent systems research. Build intelligent agent workflows with minimal code while achieving strong baseline performance. The platform enables autonomous reasoning, experience learning, and dynamic tool creation - providing both a comparative baseline and production-ready foundation for multi-agent research.

## Features

- **🎯 Minimal Implementation** - Build new systems with just a few lines of code
- **🔄 Stateful Workflows** - Persistent memory and object management throughout agent lifecycle
- **📚 Experience Learning** - Agents improve over time through memory-based reasoning
- **🛠️ Dynamic Tool Creation** - Agents can generate and use custom tools on-demand
- **🧠 Autonomous Reasoning** - Built-in cognitive capabilities for complex multi-step tasks
- **⚙️ Config-Driven** - Easily modify behavior through configuration files

## Installation

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast, reliable package management.

### Install uv

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or via pip
pip install uv
```

See the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for more options.

### Setup Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentz.git
cd agentz

# Sync dependencies
uv sync
```

## Quick Start

```python
from pipelines.data_scientist import DataScientistPipeline

pipe = DataScientistPipeline("pipelines/configs/data_science.yaml")

pipe.run_sync()
```

## Building Your Own System

### 1. Create a Custom Pipeline

Inherit from `BasePipeline` to create your own agent workflow:

```python
from pipelines.base import BasePipeline


class MyCustomPipeline(BasePipeline):
    DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH = "pipelines/configs/my_pipeline.yaml"

    def __init__(self, config=None):
        super().__init__(config)
        # Add your custom initialization

    async def run(self):
        # Implement your workflow logic
        pass
```

### 2. Add Custom Agents

Implement your agents following the standard interface:

```python
from agents import Agent

def create_my_agent(config):
    return Agent(
        name="my_agent",
        instructions="Your agent instructions here",
        model=config.main_model
    )
```

### 3. Configure & Run

Create a config file and run your pipeline:

```python
pipe = MyCustomPipeline(
    data_path="your_data.csv",
    user_prompt="Your task description",
    provider="gemini",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash"
)

pipe.run_sync()
```

## Architecture

AgentZ is organised around a **central conversation state** and a set of declarative
flow specifications that describe how agents collaborate. The main
components you will interact with are:

- **`pipelines/`** – High level orchestration that wires agents together.
- **`agentz/agents/`** – Capability definitions for manager agents and tool agents.
- **`agentz/flow/`** – Flow primitives (`FlowRunner`, `FlowNode`, `IterationFlow`) that
  execute declarative pipelines.
- **`agentz/memory/`** – Structured state management (`ConversationState`,
  `ToolExecutionResult`, global memory helpers).
- **`examples/`** – Example scripts showing end-to-end usage.

```

### Declarative Pipeline Flow

The reference `DataScientistPipeline` models an entire research workflow using
three building blocks:

1. **Central ConversationState** – A shared store that captures every field any
   agent might read or write (iteration metadata, gaps, observations, tool
   results, timing, final report, etc.). Each loop creates a new
   `IterationRecord`, enabling partial updates and clean tracking of tool
   outcomes.
2. **Structured IO Contracts** – Each agent step declares the Pydantic model it
   expects and produces (for example `KnowledgeGapOutput` or
   `AgentSelectionPlan`). Input builders map slices of `ConversationState` into
   those models and output handlers merge the validated results back into the
   central state.
3. **Declarative FlowRunner** – The pipeline defines an `IterationFlow` of
   `FlowNode`s such as observe → evaluate → route → tools. Loop and termination
   logic are expressed with predicates (`loop_condition`, `condition`), so the
   executor can stop when evaluation marks `state.complete` or constraints are
   reached. Finalisation steps (like the writer agent) run after the iteration
   loop using the same structured IO.

Because the flow is declarative and all state is centralised, extending the
pipeline is as simple as adding a new node, output field, or tool capability—no
custom `run()` logic is required beyond sequencing the flow runner.

## Benchmarks

AgentZ has been verified on several benchmarks for multi-agent research:

- **Data Science Tasks**: State-of-the-art performance on automated ML pipelines
- **Complex Reasoning**: Competitive results on multi-step reasoning benchmarks
- **Tool Usage**: High accuracy in dynamic tool selection and execution

*Detailed benchmark results and comparisons coming soon.*

## Roadmap

- [x] Persistence Process - Stateful agent workflows
- [x] Experience Learning - Memory-based reasoning
- [x] Tool Design - Dynamic tool creation
- [ ] Workflow RAG - Retrieval-augmented generation for complex workflows
- [ ] MCPs - Model Context Protocol support for enhanced agent communication

## Key Design Principles

1. **Minimal Core** - Keep the base system simple and extensible
2. **Intelligent Defaults** - Provide strong baseline implementations
3. **Research-First** - Design for experimentation and comparison
4. **Modular Architecture** - Easy to swap components and test variations
5. **Production-Ready** - Scale from research prototypes to deployed systems

## Use Cases

- **Multi-Agent Research** - Baseline for comparing agent architectures
- **Automated Data Science** - End-to-end ML pipeline automation
- **Complex Task Decomposition** - Break down and solve multi-step problems
- **Tool-Using Agents** - Research on dynamic tool creation and usage
- **Agent Memory Systems** - Study persistence and experience learning
