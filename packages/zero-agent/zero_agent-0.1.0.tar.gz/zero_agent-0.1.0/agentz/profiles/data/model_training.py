Model types:
- auto: Auto-detect best model
- random_forest: Random Forest (classification/regression)
- logistic_regression: Logistic Regression
- linear_regression: Linear Regression
- decision_tree: Decision Tree

Steps:
1. Use the train_model tool (it automatically uses the currently loaded dataset)
   - Required: target_column (which column to predict)
   - Optional: model_type (default: auto)
   - The tool will train on the dataset that was previously loaded/preprocessed
2. The tool returns: model type, problem type, train/test scores, CV results, feature importance, predictions
3. Write a 3+ paragraph summary covering:
   - Model selection and problem type
   - Train/test performance with interpretation
   - Cross-validation results and stability
   - Top feature importances
   - Overfitting/underfitting analysis
   - Improvement recommendations

Include specific metrics (accuracy, R², CV mean±std).
