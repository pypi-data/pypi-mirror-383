Dataset shift analysis and characterization in python
## What is `dashi`?
`dashi` is a Python library for **analyzing and characterizing temporal and multi-source dataset shifts**. It offers 
**unsupervised and supervised tools** for quantifying and visualizing covariate, concept, and prior shifts, supporting 
**trustworthy artificial intelligence development and evaluation**.

### Key Features:

- **Shift scope:**
  - **Temporal**: Outlines changes in data over time, enabling analysis of trends, seasonality, and abrupt shifts across different periods or temporal batches. This scope requires data to be labelled with a date.
  - **Source/domain**: Allows analysis of differences between multiple data sources or domains, being useful for identifying variability, biases, or inconsistencies among data from different origins, such as hospitals, laboratories, or geographic regions. This scope requires data to be labelled with the source/domain, without any specific chronological order.


- **Types of dataset shifts:**
  - **Covariate**: Changes in the distribution of input variables (features), while the relationship between inputs and 
  outputs remain the same.
  - **Prior**: Changes in the distribution of the target variable (labels or outcomes), while the 
  conditional distribution of features given the label remains stable.
  - **Concept**: Changes in the relationship between input variables and the target variable, i.e., the 
  conditional distribution of the target given the features changes or vice versa.


- **Unsupervised approach:** 
Distribution-based, model-agnostic delineation and characterization of dataset shifts by analysing the data covariate 
and outcome-conditional statistical distributions and projecting and visualizing their dissimilarities across the 
temporal or source scope. 
This process involves:
  - Estimating data statistical distributions across batches along the temporal or source scope.
  - Projecting these distributions onto non-parametric statistical manifolds based on different embedding functions 
  including the Jensen-Shannon distance + Multi Dimensional Scaling and Principal Component Analysis.


- **Supervised approach:**
Model-based delineation and characterization of dataset shifts, by relying on automated generation of classification or 
regression models trained on batched data across the selected scope (temporal or multi-source). This allows for the 
detailed analysis of how dataset shifts impact model performance, helping to pinpoint areas of potential degradation. 
This process involves:
  - Training classification or regression models using Random Forests across batches along the selected scope.
  - Calculating model contingency matrices pairwise across the batched models and evaluating multiple evaluation metrics.


### Main `dashi`'s outcomes:
To aid exploration, interpretation and quantification of dataset shifts, `dashi` includes **visual analytics** and 
**metrics** to reveal patterns of latent variability in the data, uncovering hidden trends and shifts, and measuring 
the shifting magnitude, such as:

- **Data Temporal Heatmaps (DTHs):** Provide an interactive exploratory visualization for temporal shifts in data distributions.
- **Information Geometric Temporal (IGT) plots:** Offer an holistic view of temporal data variability by means of embedding the analysed temporal batches in their latent statistical manifolds. Enables delineating trends, seasonality, and abrupt shifts in a single, interactive 2D or 3D plot.
- **Data Source Maps (DSMs):** Provide an exploratory visualization for multi-source shifts in data distributions.
- **Multi-Source Variability (MSV) plots:** Offer an holistic view of multi-source data variability by means of embedding source/domain batches in their latent statistical manifolds. Enables delineating source differences, clustering behaviour, and the change magnitudes, in a single, interactive 2D or 3D plot.
- **Multi-Source Variability metrics:** These MSV analysis includes the following shift metrics:
  - Global Probabilistic Deviation (GPD): Measures the degree of global variability among the distributions of multiple sources. It is based on embedding all sources in a full-dimensional geometric simplex using their pairwise Jensen-Shannon distances, providing a normalized, dimensional-independent metric equivalent to a standard deviation among probability distributions.
  - Source Probabilistic Outlyingness (SPO): Measures the dissimilarity of the distribution of a single data source to a global latent average. It provides a normalized, dimensional-independent metric of the probabilistic dissimilarity of a source to the central tendency of the simplex projection as described in the GPD.
- **Multi-batch contingency matrices:** Compare multiple evaluation metrics (F1-Score, Recall, Precision, AUC, etc.) across training-test combinations between pairwise batches, either temporal or multi-source.
