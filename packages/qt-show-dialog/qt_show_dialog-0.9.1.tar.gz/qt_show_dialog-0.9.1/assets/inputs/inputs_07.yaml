# Set pass/fail buttons
# The difference between this and `inputs_06` is that the icon images are not in Qt's resources,
# rather they're loaded as external files.
#
# Paths to external files (button icons in this case) can be absolute or relative. If relative,
# then it's relative to the current working directory (usually where the command was executed).

    Pass / Fail buttons have their text and icons changed.
    In this example, the icons are external files with paths
    relative to the current working directory.
