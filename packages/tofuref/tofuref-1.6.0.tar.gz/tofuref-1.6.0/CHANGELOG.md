## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.0] - 2025-10-12

### Added

- Many big speed improvements
    - Some things are now done in parallel
    - Asynchronous access to the filesystem, should greatly increase responsiveness on slow disks
    - Some widgets are now not showing until they are ready
    - Check for cached doesn't happen for every single entry
    - Loading indicator on startup to let things load faster in the background
    - Config options for loading times notifications and for ignoring cache, mainly for development purposes
- Backspace and left arrow to go back up a level (content ‚Üí resources ‚Üí providers)
- Header with status bar, project links and a logo

### Changed

- Redesigned layout
- Providers by the `opentofu` organization are not displayed, because they are forks and originals should be used
- Purge from cache doesn't appear (and doesn't work) when the item is not cached
- Code block selection is now shown in the content window, not as a maximized window

### Fixed

- When exiting the Table of Contents, the document will no longer scroll to the top
- Copy code blocks window now disappears when it loses focus
- tofuref will try to strip long documents to prevent from freezing, target configurable by `markdown_length_target` (default 40 000)
  - For example, `kubernetes_deployment_v1` document is over 170k characters long with many different elements
    that are demanding for underlying libraries to process. For now we're stripping based on heading for
    nested sections, with less nested sections being stripped last.

### Removed

- Temporarily dropped python 3.14 support because `aiopath` is not yet compatible, the speed is worth it for now
- Fullscreen mode, redesigned layout should be good even on narrow viewports
- Log widget, if need be a log file might be added later
- Subtitles moved to the header from subtitles in the border

## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-09

### Added

- Improved perceived responsiveness during app launch and when loading large providers
    - Subtitles now inform what is happening in the background
    - The screen gets refreshed more often, resulting in somewhat working loading indicators
    - Eliminate initial layout ‚Äújumping‚Äù
    - Note: Launch may be slightly slower; changes focus on perceived responsiveness

### Changed

- Default borders changed from `ascii` to `vkey`, you can still revert to `ascii` with your local configuration
- Welcome content was refreshed

### Fixed

- Normalized em/en dashes to hyphens so headings render correctly in the content viewer
- Corrected the cache purge notification to refer to the right item type (Resource vs Provider)
- Set a more descriptive subtitle for resource content pages
- Open in browser in the welcome tab now opens this changelog instead of crashing the application

## [1.4.0] - 2025-07-30

### Added

- In provider window, GitHub repo of the provider can now be opened in a browser with `ctrl+g`

### Added

    - Index of providers is valid for a month, to force refresh: `rm ~/.cache/tofuref/index.json`
