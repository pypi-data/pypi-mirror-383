autoSetup and autoTeardown: 

Automatically setup and teardown an env by running some 
commands on the Keystack server and/or run some commands 
on remote devices before running test.

Example 1:

  autoSetup:
      execCliCmdsOnKeystackServer:
            - ls -l /home/jdoe
            - python3 myScript.py
            
      # Only SSH and Telnet connections are supported
      # Keystack will get the device's connection-protocol from either the lab 
      # Inventory or from the env devices
      execCliCmdsOnEnvDevices:
            # device_1 is the device name
            # Followed by a list of commands to enter if logged into the device
            device_1:
                - cat /etc/os-release
                - ls -l /home/jdoe/Downloads
              
  autoTeardown:
      <Same as autoSetup>



Example 2:

    location: San Jose
    notes: Add some notes

    devices:
      device_1:
          ipAddress: 192.168.28.11
          ipPort: 23
          connectionProtocol: telnet
          loginName: jdoe

      # Alternatively, get device details from the KeystackUI Lab Inventory
      device_1: get_device_details_from_inventory

    portGroups:
      - portGroup1

    dataConfigs:
        param1: value0

    autoSetup:
      execCliCmdsOnKeystackServer:
          - ls -l /home/jdoe

      execCliCmdsOnEnvDevices:
          device_1:
                - cat /etc/os-release
                - ls -l /home/jdoe/Downloads

    autoTeardown:
      <same as autoSetup>
