Env Load Balancer
-----------------
  - Env load-balancing automatically provides an available Env (testbed) instead of statically
    defining an Env to use by stating the load-balancing group name
  - Env load-balancing is only supported by running the Keystack docker container (KeystackUI)
  - To create a load-balance group:
       - Go on the KeystackUI, on the side panel, Envs, select Load-Balance-Mgmt
       - In playbooks, set loadBalanceGroup: <load-balance-group-name>
       - You could set loadBalanceGroup at the globaSettings, under Stages and Stage Task.

  - If you set loadBalanceGroup in globalSettings, all stage tasks will get available envs to use.
  - If a stage or a task don't require an Env, then set ->  env: not-required
    Keystack will not assign an env for the stage or the stage task

  NOTES:
    - For env load balancing, the env must be added to the DB inside the keystack docker container. 
      Keystack Load-balancer looks for some keywords.
    - If you manually created new env YAML files, Keystack will automatically add the env to
      the KeystackUI Env table when user clicks on:
          - Envs UI page
          - Env Load Balance UI page
