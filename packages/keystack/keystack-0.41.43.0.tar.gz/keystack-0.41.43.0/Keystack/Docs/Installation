Installation requirements:
    - MUST BE a SUDO user
    - docker
    - Python >= 3.7
    - Linux OS host server

During the "setup" installation, you will be asked where to install Keystack folders and 
the full path to the Python executable.
By default, Keystack folders will be installed at the directory /opt. 

If you don't know the full path to your Python executable, enter: which python3
You will get something like this: /usr/local/bin/python3  <-- full path

With internet connection:
    1> pip install keystack

    2> Then INSTALL Keystack docker container
       Enter: keystack setup -docker
      
    3> To UPDATE existing Keystack installation:
       1> pip install keystack -U
       2> keystack upgrade -docker

       To install a specific Keystack docker version
          - Enter: keystack upgrade -docker -version <version>

Without internet connection:
    - Get an installation zip file from the Keystack maintainer
    - Unzip
    - cd to the folder
    - Enter: python3 setupKeystack.py -setup -dockerBuildImagePath ./docker.tar

    - To update existing Keystack installation:
      Enter: python3 setupKeystack.py -update -dockerBuildImagePath ./docker.tar

To test out the installation:
    - Go on a web browser and enter: https://<host ip address>
    - Login: admin
    - Password: admin

    On the Linux CLI and enter:
        Most simplest way to run:     keystack run -playbook Samples/pythonSample -domain Communal
        This does the same as above:  keystack run -playbook DOMAIN=Communal/Samples/pythonSample
        Give your test a session Id:  keystack run -playbook Samples/pythonSample -domain Communal -sessionId myTest


After the installation, you need to logout of Linux and relogin because the installation 
created a new Keystack user-group and added you as the user to the Keystack group.
You will not be able to enter the Keystack folders without logging out and relogin.

New installation created folders:

    /opt/KeystackTests
        /Envs

        /Playbooks

        /Modules
            /Demo

        /Testcases
        /Results
        /ResultsArchive
        /Reconfigs

    /opt/KeystackSystem
        keystackSystemSettings.env
        .loginCredentials
        /Logs


Post Installation:
------------------
   There are a few ways to RUN Keystack:

   - On the Keystack host server CLI
   - Inside the Keystack container
   - From the KeystackUI
   - ReST API

   The CLI command inside and outside of the container:
        keystack run -playbook Samples/advance -domain Communal

   To run from CLI in secured mode, user must get their api-key from the KeystackUI 
   accountMgr and put it in the user's env variables

   1> Log into Keystack UI: admin/admin
   2> Create a new user
   3> Get new user's API-Key

   4> Enable cli-secured-mode:
      Edit /opt/KeystackSystem/keystackSystemSettings.yml
      cliSecuredMode: True
