Dynamic: summary

This package provides code for

1. generating microlensing magnification maps,
2. locating microlensing critical curves and caustics, and
3. determining the number of microlensing caustic crossings,

all on GPUs. It relies on python wrappers around C++/CUDA libraries which have
been precompiled and included with this package for linux_x86_64 architectures.
Compilation used the GNU compiler v11.2.0 and the CUDA compiler v12.4. They 
*should* work for Linux distributions that have GLIBC >= 2.31 and 
GLIBCXX >= 3.4.29, but no promises.
