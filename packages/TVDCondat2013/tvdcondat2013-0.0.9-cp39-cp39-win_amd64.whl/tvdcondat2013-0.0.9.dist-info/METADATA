License: CeCILL FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
        
        Version 2.1 dated 2013-06-21
        
        
            Notice
        
        This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result
        of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
        the two main principles guiding its drafting:
        
          * firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
            of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to users,
          * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which it
            is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual
            property law, and the protection that it offers to both authors and
            holders of the economic rights over software.
        
        The authors of the CeCILL (for Ce[a] C[nrs] I[nria] L[ogiciel] L[ibre]) 
        license are:

            Preamble
        
        The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
        the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this
        license within the framework of an open source distribution model.
        
        The exercising of this right is conditional upon certain obligations for
        users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent redistributions.
        
        In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
        modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
        with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the
        economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.
        
        In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
        and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
        the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
        complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
        developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
        knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
        suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions
        enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,
        more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of
        security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,
        provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or
        removed herefrom.
        
        This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
        the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.

        modifying the Software. If these patents are transferred, the Licensor
        undertakes to have the transferees subscribe to the obligations set
        forth in this paragraph.
        
        
              5.1 RIGHT OF USE

            Article 6 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
        
        
              6.1 OVER THE INITIAL SOFTWARE
        
        The Holder owns the economic rights over the Initial Software. Any or
        all use of the Initial Software is subject to compliance with the terms
        and conditions under which the Holder has elected to distribute its work
        and no one shall be entitled to modify the terms and conditions for the
        distribution of said Initial Software.
        
        The Holder undertakes that the Initial Software will remain ruled at
        least by this Agreement, for the duration set forth in Article 4.2 <#term>.
        
        
              6.2 OVER THE CONTRIBUTIONS
        
        The Licensee who develops a Contribution is the owner of the
        intellectual property rights over this Contribution as defined by
        applicable law.
        
        
              6.3 OVER THE EXTERNAL MODULES
        
        The Licensee who develops an External Module is the owner of the
        intellectual property rights over this External Module as defined by
        applicable law and is free to choose the type of agreement that shall
        govern its distribution.
        
        
              6.4 JOINT PROVISIONS
        
        The Licensee expressly undertakes:
        
         1. not to remove, or modify, in any manner, the intellectual property
            notices attached to the Software;
        
         2. to reproduce said notices, in an identical manner, in the copies of
            the Software modified or not.
        
        The Licensee undertakes not to directly or indirectly infringe the
        intellectual property rights on the Software of the Holder and/or
        Contributors, and to take, where applicable, vis-à-vis its staff, any
        and all measures required to ensure respect of said intellectual
        property rights of the Holder and/or Contributors.
        
        
            Article 7 - RELATED SERVICES
        
        7.1 Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to
        provide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.
        
        However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The
        terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such
        maintenance, shall be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the
        Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services
        shall incur liability therefor.
        
        7.2 Similarly, any Licensor is entitled to offer to its licensees, under
        its sole responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon
        itself, for the redistribution of the Software and/or the Modified
        Software, under terms and conditions that it is free to decide. Said
        warranty, and the financial terms and conditions of its application,
        shall be subject of a separate instrument executed between the Licensor
        and the Licensee.

        entitled to claim compensation for any direct loss it may have suffered
        from the Software as a result of a fault on the part of the relevant
        Licensor, subject to providing evidence thereof.
        
        8.2 The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under
        this Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result of in particular:
        (i) loss due the Licensee's total or partial failure to fulfill its
        obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss that is suffered by the
        Licensee due to the use or performance of the Software, and (iii) more
        generally, any consequential loss. In particular the Parties expressly
        agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data,
        loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders,
        opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all
        legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,
        shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to
        any or all compensation from the Licensor.
        
        
            Article 9 - WARRANTY
        
        9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
        state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
        possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of
        possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's
        attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
        modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are
        reserved for experienced users.
        
        The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,
        the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working
        order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons
        or properties.
        
        9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled
        to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the
        rights set forth in Article 5 <#scope>).
        
        9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by
        the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than
        that provided for in Article 9.2 <#good-faith> and, in particular,
        without any warranty as to its commercial value, its secured, safe,
        innovative or relevant nature.
        
        Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free
        from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will
        be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software
        configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.
        
        9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
        Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
        relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,
        the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee
        arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be
        instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the
        Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
        the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal
        expertise for its defense. Such technical and legal expertise shall be
        decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the
        Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor
        disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the
        name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of
        prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence
        of a trademark.
        
        
            Article 10 - TERMINATION

TVDCondat2013
==============

*UPDATE 2025* : Still using that code as is, I updated the references and I am now preparing a `pip` package precompiled for Window/Mac/Linux. I'm also updating the method to a more optimised version.

Version 2 of the tools implements Condat's 2017 improvements, providing faster convergence while keeping the same interface.

TVDCondat2013 is a python portage of the 1D Total Variation Denoising algorithm from Condat 2013: _A Direct Algorithm for 1D Total Variation Denoising_ (Sign. Proc. Letters, DOI:10.1109/LSP.2013.2278339) using pybind11 to bind C++ and NumPy directly.

The `c++` core code has been adapted from `C` version available on the website of the manuscript orignal authors: [The Paper](https://lcondat.github.io/publis/Condat-fast_TV-SPL-2013.pdf)
*Cite it if you use it.*

This package is mostly to train myself packging a python package from `c++` but also it is a really useful and efficient algorithm for:
- Direct denoising for data that can be represented by flat segments
- Indirect curve denoising using a detrend-denoise-retrend approach (Not implemented yet)

*The package still is under active development*

This work

Quick start
------------

So far the following denoising of a `numpy` array are implemented. The
original 2013 algorithm, the faster 2017 variant, a taut string algorithm, and
a fused lasso variant with an additional :math:`\ell_1` penalty are exposed:

```
from TVDCondat2013 import fused_lasso, tvd_2013, tvd_2017, tvd_tautstring
...
denoised_v1 = tvd_2013(MyNumpyArray, lambda_TVD)       # 2013 algorithm
denoised_v2 = tvd_2017(MyNumpyArray, lambda_TVD)       # 2017 algorithm
denoised_ts = tvd_tautstring(MyNumpyArray, lambda_TVD) # taut string
denoised_fl = fused_lasso(MyNumpyArray, lambda_TVD, mu_L1) # fused lasso
...

```

Run `python examples/example_readme.py` to generate a figure comparing the
original, noisy, and denoised signals using all algorithms. The script builds a
piecewise-constant signal, corrupts it with Gaussian noise, denoises it with
``tvd_2013``, ``tvd_2017``, ``tvd_tautstring`` and ``fused_lasso``, and plots
the results in aligned subplots, saving the figure as `examples/Example.png`.

More working examples in the `examples` folder.

Installation
------------

I am working on developing a `pip` and a `conda` package at point.

**On Unix (Linux, OS X)**

 - clone this repository
 - `pip install ./TVDCondat2013`

**On Windows (Requires Visual Studio 2015)**

 - For Python 3.5:
     - clone this repository
     - `pip install ./TVDCondat2013`
 - For earlier versions of Python, including Python 2.7:

   Building requires a C++14 compliant compiler (i.e. Visual Studio 2015 on
   Windows). Running a regular `pip install` command will detect the version
   of the compiler used to build Python and attempt to build the extension
   with it. We must force the use of Visual Studio 2015.

     - clone this repository
     - `"%VS140COMNTOOLS%\..\..\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x64`
     - `set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1`
     - `set MSSdk=1`
     - `pip install ./TVDCondat2013`

   Note that this requires the user building `TVDCondat2013` to have registry edition
   rights on the machine, to be able to run the `vcvarsall.bat` script.


Windows runtime requirements
----------------------------

On Windows, the Visual C++ 2015 redistributable packages are a runtime
requirement for this project. It can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145).

If you use the Anaconda python distribution, you may require the Visual Studio
runtime as a platform-dependent runtime requirement for you package:

```yaml
requirements:
  build:
    - python
    - setuptools
    - pybind11

  run:
   - python
   - vs2015_runtime  # [win]
```


Building the documentation
--------------------------

Documentation for the example project is generated using Sphinx. Sphinx has the
ability to automatically inspect the signatures and documentation strings in
the extension module to generate beautiful documentation in a variety formats.
The following command generates HTML-based reference documentation; for other
formats please refer to the Sphinx manual:

 - `TVDCondat2013/docs`
 - `pip install sphinx furo`
 - `make html`


Running the tests
-----------------

Running the tests requires `pytest`.

```bash
py.test .
```

Wheel integrity checks
----------------------

The repository ships with `wheelhouse/debug_wheel.py` which inspects wheel
archives for CRC mismatches and shifted local headers. If the script reports a
corrupted member it means the payload was modified after the wheel was built
(`strip` and some antivirus scanners are known to do this). Always rebuild the
wheel instead of editing an existing archive in place; otherwise `pip` will
reject the file. The release workflow runs this validator on the freshly
produced wheels and fails fast if corruption is detected. Because every run
builds wheels from a clean checkout, removing any committed artefacts and
rerunning the workflow is sufficient to resolve earlier corruption reports.
