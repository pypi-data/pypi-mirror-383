# taco-compression
This is the official implementation of the TACO compression algorithm for time series [1]. 

# Installation

Please install via pip:
```shell
pip install tacocompression
```

# Usage
There are two usage modes, one as a command line tool operating on files, the other as callables from within python.

## Command Line

Please use `python -m tacocompression` to (de)compress your time series from the command line interface. This
application takes 4 named keyword arguments and at least one additional argument specifying the input(s). These inputs
are the paths to the files/directory of the (compressed) time series. You can either specify a directory from which all 
csv files are read...

```shell
python -m tacocompression -o=compressed time_series
```

... or by passing the paths to the files directly.

```shell
python -m tacocompression -o=. data/time_series_1.csv data/time_series_2.csv
```

Each file must contain a single column interpreted as a univariate time series. We assume row 0 is the header. The
compressed data is saved in csv files as well.

The keyword arguments are
- mode (short: m) Use `c` to compress and `d` to decompress. Defaults to `c`.
- output (short: o) Provide a directory to save the outputs to.
- pairing_function (short: p) One of "rosenberg", "szudzik", and "cantor". Defaults to "rosenberg".
- decimals (short: d) Precision of the reconstruction, i.e., number of decimals recoverable during decompression. Only used in compression. Defaults to `1`.
- header. Whether the input file(s) contain a header. Only used in compression. Set only if true.

To decompress the above time series, use

```shell
python -m tacocompression -m=d -o=time_series compressed
```

respectively

```shell
python -m tacocompression -m=d -o=data compressed_time_series_1.csv compressed_time_series_2.csv
```

## As a Callable
```python
from tacocompression import compress, decompress

# 2 univariate time series, length 10 and 8:
time_series = [[0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6, 7.7, 8.8, 9.9], [8.8, 7.7, 6.6, 5.5, 4.4, 3.3, 2.2, 1.1]]

compressed = compress(time_series, "szudzik", 1)
reconstructed = decompress(compressed, "szudzik")

assert time_series == reconstructed
```
