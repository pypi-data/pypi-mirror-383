# MCP Inflectra Spira Server
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enabling AI assistants to interact with Spira by Inflectra.

## Overview
This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI assistants (like Claude) to interact with the Inflectra Spira platform, providing a bridge between natural language interactions and the Spira REST API.

This server supports all three editions of Spira:
- **SpiraTest:** Test Management When You Need Quality, Agility & Speed 
- **SpiraTeam:** Project, Requirements Management & ALM For Agile Teams 
- **SpiraPlan:** Program Management & ALM For Scaling Agile & Enterprises   


## Features
The Spira MCP server current implements the following features:

### My Work
This feature provides easy access to the list of artifacts that have been assigned to the current user

- **My Tasks:** Provides operations for working with the Spira tasks I have been assigned
- **My Requirements:** Provides operations for working with the Spira requirements I have been assigned
- **My Incidents:** Provides operations for working with the Spira incidents I have been assigned
- **My Test Cases:** Provides operations for working with the Spira test cases I have been assigned
- **My Test Sets:** Provides operations for working with the Spira test sets I have been assigned

### Workspaces
This feature provides tools that let you retrieve and modify the different workspaces inside Spira

- **Programs:** Provides operations for working with Spira programs
- **Products:** Provides operations for working with Spira products
- **Product Templates:** Provides operations for working with Spira product templates

### Program Artifacts
This feature provides tools that let you retrieve and modify the different artifacts inside a Spira program

- **Capabilities:** Provides operations for working with the Spira capabilities in a program backlog
- **Milestones:** Provides operations for working with the Spira milestones in a program

### Product Artifacts
This feature provides tools that let you retrieve and modify the different artifacts inside a Spira product

- **Requirements:** Provides operations for working with the Spira requirements in a product
- **Releases:** Provides operations for working with the Spira releases in a product
- **Test Cases:** Provides operations for working with the Spira test case folders and test cases in a product
- **Test Sets:** Provides operations for working with the Spira test set folders and test sets in a product
- **Test Runs:** Provides operations for working with the Spira test runs in a product
- **Tasks:** Provides operations for working with the Spira tasks in a product
- **Incidents:** Provides operations for working with the Spira incidents (e.g. bugs, enhancements, issues, etc.) in a product
- **Automation Hosts:** Provides operations for working with the Spira automation hosts in a product

### Template Configuration
This feature provides tools that let you view and modify the configuration and settings of Spira product templates

- **Artifact Types:** Retrieves information on the artifact types in a product template, and their sub-types
- **Custom Properties:** Retrieves information on the artifact types in a product template, and their custom properties

### Automation
This feature provides tools that let you integrate automated DevOps tools such as test automation frameworks and CI/CD pipelines

- **Automated Test Runs:** Provides operations for recording automated test run results into Spira
- **Builds:** Provides operations for recording the results of CI/CD builds into Spira

### Specifications
Provides operations for retrieving the product specification files that
can be used to build the functionality of the product using AI. 
This is used by Agentic AI development tools such as Amazon Kiro
for building applications from a formal spec.

This module provides the following MCP tools for retrieving the entire product specifications:
- **get_specification_requirements** - returns the data for populating the `requirements.md` file
- **get_specification_design** - returns the data for populating the `design.md` file
- **get_specification_tasks** - returns the data for populating the `tasks.md` file
- **get_specification_test_cases** - returns the data for populating the `test-cases.md` file

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Inflectra Spira cloud account with appropriate permissions
- Username and active API Key (RSS Token) for this instance

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Inflectra/mcp-server-spira.git
cd mcp-server-spira

# Simple development mode install
pip install -e .

# Install into a virtual development environment (you may need to create one with uv venv)
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install from PyPi
pip install mcp-server-spira
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
INFLECTRA_SPIRA_BASE_URL=The base URL for your instance of Spira (typically https://mycompany.spiraservice.net or https://demo-xx.spiraservice.net/mycompany)
INFLECTRA_SPIRA_USERNAME=The login name you use to access Spira
INFLECTRA_SPIRA_API_KEY=The API Key (RSS Token) you use to access the Spira REST API
```

Note: Make sure your API Key is active and saved in your Spira user profile.

### Running the Server directly

```bash
# Development mode with the MCP Inspector
mcp dev src/mcp_server_spira/server.py

# Production mode using shell / command line
python -m mcp_server_spira

# Install in Claude Desktop
mcp install src/mcp_server_spira/server.py --name "Inflectra Spira Server"
```

### Running the MCP Server from Cline

To run the MCP server from within Cline, you don't use the commands above, instead you add the Inflectra MCP server to the configuration JSON file `cline_mcp_settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "inflectra-spira": {
      "autoApprove": [
        "get_my_incidents",
        "get_products",
        "get_test_cases"
      ],
      "timeout": 60,
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "C:\\Git\\mcp-server-spira",
        "run",
        "main.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "INFLECTRA_SPIRA_BASE_URL": "https://mycompany.spiraservice.net",
        "INFLECTRA_SPIRA_USERNAME": "login",
        "INFLECTRA_SPIRA_API_KEY": "{XXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXX}"
      },
      "type": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

### Running the MCP Server from Kiro

To run the MCP server from within Kiro, you don't use the commands above, instead you add the Inflectra MCP server to the configuration JSON file `mcp.json`:

```json

  "mcpServers": {
    "inflectra-spira": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "C:\\Git\\mcp-server-spira",
        "run",
        "main.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "INFLECTRA_SPIRA_BASE_URL": "https://myinstance.spiraservice.net",
        "INFLECTRA_SPIRA_USERNAME": "mylogin",
        "INFLECTRA_SPIRA_API_KEY": "{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXX}"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [
        "get_specification_requirements",
        "get_specification_design",
        "get_specification_tasks",

## Development

The project is structured into feature modules, each implementing specific Inflectra Spira capabilities:

- `features/mywork`: Accessing a user's assigned artifacts and updating their status/progress
- `features/projects`: Project management capabilities
- `features/programs`: Program management features
- `utils`: Common utilities and client initialization
