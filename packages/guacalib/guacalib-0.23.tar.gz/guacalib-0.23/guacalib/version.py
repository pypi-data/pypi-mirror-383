"""Guacamole library version information.

This module defines the version string for the Guacamole management library
(guacalib). The version follows semantic versioning conventions and is used
throughout the library for identification, compatibility checks, and user-facing
displays.

The version number is incremented according to the following rules:
- MAJOR version: Incompatible API changes
- MINOR version: Backward-compatible functionality additions
- PATCH version: Backward-compatible bug fixes

This constant is imported by other modules to provide version information
in CLI help text, logging, and error messages.
