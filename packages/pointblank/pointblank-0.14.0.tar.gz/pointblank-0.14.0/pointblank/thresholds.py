@dataclass
class Thresholds:
    """
    Definition of threshold values.

    Thresholds are used to set limits on the number of failing test units at different levels. The
    levels are 'warning', 'error', and 'critical'. These levels correspond to different levels of
    severity when a threshold is reached. The threshold values can be set as absolute counts or as
    fractions of the total number of test units. When a threshold is reached, an action can be taken
    (e.g., displaying a message or calling a function) if there is an associated action defined for
    that level (defined through the [`Actions`](`pointblank.Actions`) class).

    Parameters
    ----------
    warning
        The threshold for the 'warning' level. This can be an absolute count or a fraction of the
        total. Using `True` will set this threshold value to `1`.
    error
        The threshold for the 'error' level. This can be an absolute count or a fraction of the
        total. Using `True` will set this threshold value to `1`.
    critical
        The threshold for the 'critical' level. This can be an absolute count or a fraction of the
        total. Using `True` will set this threshold value to `1`.

    Returns
    -------
    Thresholds
        A `Thresholds` object. This can be used when using the [`Validate`](`pointblank.Validate`)
        class (to set thresholds globally) or when defining validation steps like
        [`col_vals_gt()`](`pointblank.Validate.col_vals_gt`) (so that threshold values are scoped to
        individual validation steps, overriding any global thresholds).

    Examples
    --------
    ```{python}
    #| echo: false
    #| output: false
    import pointblank as pb
    pb.config(report_incl_footer=False)
    ```
    In a data validation workflow, you can set thresholds for the number of failing test units at
    different levels. For example, you can set a threshold for the 'warning' level when the number
    of failing test units exceeds 10% of the total number of test units:

    ```{python}
    thresholds_1 = pb.Thresholds(warning=0.1)
    ```

    You can also set thresholds for the 'error' and 'critical' levels:

    ```{python}
    thresholds_2 = pb.Thresholds(warning=0.1, error=0.2, critical=0.05)
    ```

    Thresholds can also be set as absolute counts. Here's an example where the 'warning' level is
    set to `5` failing test units:

    ```{python}
    thresholds_3 = pb.Thresholds(warning=5)
    ```

    The `thresholds` object can be used to set global thresholds for all validation steps. Or, you
    can set thresholds for individual validation steps, which will override the global thresholds.
    Here's a data validation workflow example where we set global thresholds and then override with
    different thresholds at the [`col_vals_gt()`](`pointblank.Validate.col_vals_gt`) step:

    ```{python}
    validation = (
        pb.Validate(
            data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table"),
            label="Example Validation",
            thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=0.1, error=0.2, critical=0.3)
        )
        .col_vals_not_null(columns=["c", "d"])
        .col_vals_gt(columns="a", value=3, thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=5))
        .interrogate()
    )

    validation
    ```

    As can be seen, the last step ([`col_vals_gt()`](`pointblank.Validate.col_vals_gt`)) has its own
    thresholds, which override the global thresholds set at the beginning of the validation workflow
    (in the [`Validate`](`pointblank.Validate`) class).

@dataclass
class Actions:
    """
    Definition of action values.

    Actions complement threshold values by defining what action should be taken when a threshold
    level is reached. The action can be a string or a `Callable`. When a string is used, it is
    interpreted as a message to be displayed. When a `Callable` is used, it will be invoked at
    interrogation time if the threshold level is met or exceeded.

    There are three threshold levels: 'warning', 'error', and 'critical'. These levels correspond
    to different levels of severity when a threshold is reached. Those thresholds can be defined
    using the [`Thresholds`](`pointblank.Thresholds`) class or various shorthand forms. Actions
    don't have to be defined for all threshold levels; if an action is not defined for a level in
    exceedance, no action will be taken. Likewise, there is no negative consequence (other than a
    no-op) for defining actions for thresholds that don't exist (e.g., setting an action for the
    'critical' level when no corresponding 'critical' threshold has been set).

    Parameters
    ----------
    warning
        A string, `Callable`, or list of `Callable`/string values for the 'warning' level. Using
        `None` means no action should be performed at the 'warning' level.
    error
        A string, `Callable`, or list of `Callable`/string values for the 'error' level. Using
        `None` means no action should be performed at the 'error' level.
    critical
        A string, `Callable`, or list of `Callable`/string values for the 'critical' level. Using
        `None` means no action should be performed at the 'critical' level.
    default
        A string, `Callable`, or list of `Callable`/string values for all threshold levels. This
        parameter can be used to set the same action for all threshold levels. If an action is
        defined for a specific threshold level, it will override the action set for all levels.
    highest_only
        A boolean value that, when set to `True` (the default), results in executing only the action
        for the highest threshold level that is exceeded. Useful when you want to ensure that only
        the most severe action is taken when multiple threshold levels are exceeded.

    Returns
    -------
    Actions
        An `Actions` object. This can be used when using the [`Validate`](`pointblank.Validate`)
        class (to set actions for meeting different threshold levels globally) or when defining
        validation steps like [`col_vals_gt()`](`pointblank.Validate.col_vals_gt`) (so that actions
        are scoped to individual validation steps, overriding any globally set actions).

    Types of Actions
    ----------------
    Actions can be defined in different ways:

    1. **String**: A message to be displayed when the threshold level is met or exceeded.
    2. **Callable**: A function that is called when the threshold level is met or exceeded.
    3. **List of Strings/Callables**: Multiple messages or functions to be called when the threshold
       level is met or exceeded.

    The actions are executed at interrogation time when the threshold level assigned to the action
    is exceeded by the number or proportion of failing test units. When providing a string, it will
    simply be printed to the console. A callable will also be executed at the time of interrogation.
    If providing a list of strings or callables, each item in the list will be executed in order.
    Such a list can contain a mix of strings and callables.

    String Templating
    -----------------
    When using a string as an action, you can include placeholders for the following variables:

    - `{type}`: The validation step type where the action is executed (e.g., 'col_vals_gt',
    'col_vals_lt', etc.)
    - `{level}`: The threshold level where the action is executed ('warning', 'error', or
    'critical')
    - `{step}` or `{i}`: The step number in the validation workflow where the action is executed
    - `{col}` or `{column}`: The column name where the action is executed
    - `{val}` or `{value}`: An associated value for the validation method (e.g., the value to
    compare against in a 'col_vals_gt' validation step)
    - `{time}`: A datetime value for when the action was executed

    The first two placeholders can also be used in uppercase (e.g., `{TYPE}` or `{LEVEL}`) and the
    corresponding values will be displayed in uppercase. The placeholders are replaced with the
    actual values during interrogation.

    For example, the string `"{LEVEL}: '{type}' threshold exceeded for column {col}."` will be
    displayed as `"WARNING: 'col_vals_gt' threshold exceeded for column a."` when the 'warning'
    threshold is exceeded in a 'col_vals_gt' validation step involving column `a`.

    Crafting Callables with `get_action_metadata()`
    -----------------------------------------------
    When creating a callable function to be used as an action, you can use the
    [`get_action_metadata()`](`pointblank.get_action_metadata`) function to retrieve metadata about
    the step where the action is executed. This metadata contains information about the validation
    step, including the step type, level, step number, column name, and associated value. You can
    use this information to craft your action message or to take specific actions based on the
    metadata provided.

    Examples
    --------
    ```{python}
    #| echo: false
    #| output: false
    import pointblank as pb
    pb.config(report_incl_footer=False)
    ```

    Let's define both threshold values and actions for a data validation workflow. We'll set these
    thresholds and actions globally for all validation steps. In this specific example, the only
    actions we'll define are for the 'critical' level:

    ```{python}
    import pointblank as pb

    validation = (
        pb.Validate(
            data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="game_revenue", tbl_type="duckdb"),
            thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=0.05, error=0.10, critical=0.15),
            actions=pb.Actions(critical="Major data quality issue found in step {step}."),
        )
        .col_vals_regex(columns="player_id", pattern=r"[A-Z]{12}[0-9]{3}")
        .col_vals_gt(columns="item_revenue", value=0.05)
        .col_vals_gt(columns="session_duration", value=15)
        .interrogate()
    )

    validation
    ```

    Because we set the 'critical' action to display `"Major data quality issue found."` in the
    console, this message will be displayed if the number of failing test units exceeds the
    'critical' threshold (set to 15% of the total number of test units). In step 3 of the validation
    workflow, the 'critical' threshold is exceeded, so the message is displayed in the console.

    Actions can be defined locally for individual validation steps, which will override any global
    actions set at the beginning of the validation workflow. Here's a variation of the above example
    where we set global threshold values but assign an action only for an individual validation
    step:

    ```{python}
    def dq_issue():
        from datetime import datetime

        print(f"Data quality issue found ({datetime.now()}).")

    validation = (
        pb.Validate(
            data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="game_revenue", tbl_type="duckdb"),
            thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=0.05, error=0.10, critical=0.15),
        )
        .col_vals_regex(columns="player_id", pattern=r"[A-Z]{12}[0-9]{3}")
        .col_vals_gt(columns="item_revenue", value=0.05)
        .col_vals_gt(
            columns="session_duration",
            value=15,
            actions=pb.Actions(warning=dq_issue),
        )
        .interrogate()
    )

    validation
    ```

    In this case, the 'warning' action is set to call the `dq_issue()` function. This action is
    only executed when the 'warning' threshold is exceeded in the 'session_duration' column. Because
    all three thresholds are exceeded in step 3, the 'warning' action of executing the function
    occurs (resulting in a message being printed to the console). If actions were set for the other
    two threshold levels, they would also be executed.

    The [`get_action_metadata()`](`pointblank.get_action_metadata`) function, which can be used to
    retrieve metadata about the step where the action is executed.

@dataclass
class FinalActions:
    """
    Define actions to be taken after validation is complete.

    Final actions are executed after all validation steps have been completed. They provide a
    mechanism to respond to the overall validation results, such as sending alerts when critical
    failures are detected or generating summary reports.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *actions
        One or more actions to execute after validation. An action can be (1) a callable function
        that will be executed with no arguments, or (2) a string message that will be printed to the
        console.

    Returns
    -------
    FinalActions
        An `FinalActions` object. This can be used when using the
        [`Validate`](`pointblank.Validate`) class (to set final actions for the validation
        workflow).

    Types of Actions
    ----------------
    Final actions can be defined in two different ways:

    1. **String**: A message to be displayed when the validation is complete.
    2. **Callable**: A function that is called when the validation is complete.

    The actions are executed at the end of the validation workflow. When providing a string, it will
    simply be printed to the console. A callable will also be executed at the time of validation
    completion. Several strings and callables can be provided to the `FinalActions` class, and
    they will be executed in the order they are provided.

    Crafting Callables with `get_validation_summary()`
    -------------------------------------------------
    When creating a callable function to be used as a final action, you can use the
    [`get_validation_summary()`](`pointblank.get_validation_summary`) function to retrieve the
    summary of the validation results. This summary contains information about the validation
    workflow, including the number of test units, the number of failing test units, and the
    threshold levels that were exceeded. You can use this information to craft your final action
    message or to take specific actions based on the validation results.

    Examples
    --------
    Final actions provide a powerful way to respond to the overall results of a validation workflow.
    They're especially useful for sending notifications, generating reports, or taking corrective
    actions based on the complete validation outcome.

    The following example shows how to create a final action that checks for critical failures
    and sends an alert:

    ```python
    import pointblank as pb

    def send_alert():
        summary = pb.get_validation_summary()
        if summary["highest_severity"] == "critical":
            print(f"ALERT: Critical validation failures found in {summary['tbl_name']}")

    validation = (
        pb.Validate(
            data=my_data,
            final_actions=pb.FinalActions(send_alert)
        )
        .col_vals_gt(columns="revenue", value=0)
        .interrogate()
    )
    ```

    In this example, the `send_alert()` function is defined to check the validation summary for
    critical failures. If any are found, an alert message is printed to the console. The function is
    passed to the `FinalActions` class, which ensures it will be executed after all validation steps
    are complete. Note that we used the
    [`get_validation_summary()`](`pointblank.get_validation_summary`) function to retrieve the
    summary of the validation results to help craft the alert message.

    Multiple final actions can be provided in a sequence. They will be executed in the order they
    are specified after all validation steps have completed:

    ```python
