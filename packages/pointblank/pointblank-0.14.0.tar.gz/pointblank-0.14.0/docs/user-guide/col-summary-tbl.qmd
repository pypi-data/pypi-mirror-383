While previewing a table with `preview()` is undoubtedly a good thing to do, sometimes you need
more. This is where summarizing a table comes in. When you view a summary of a table, the
column-by-column info can quickly increase your understanding of a dataset. Plus, it allows you to
quickly catch anomalies in your data (e.g., the maximum value of a column could be far outside the
realm of possibility).

Pointblank provides a function to make it extremely easy to view column-level summaries in a single
table. That function is called `col_summary_tbl()` and, just like `preview()` does, it supports the
use of any table that Pointblank can use for validation. And no matter what the input data is, the
resultant reporting table is consistent in its design and construction.

## Trying out `col_summary_tbl()`{.qd-no-link}

The function only requires a table. Let's use the `small_table` dataset (a very simple table) to
start us off:

```{python}
import pointblank as pb

small_table = pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table", tbl_type="polars")

pb.col_summary_tbl(small_table)
```

The header provides the type of table we're looking at (`POLARS`, since this is a Polars DataFrame)
and the table dimensions. The rest of the table focuses on the column-level summaries. As such, each
row represents a summary of a column in the `small_table` dataset. There's a lot of information in
this summary table to digest. Some of it is intuitive since this sort of table summarization isn't
all that uncommon, but other aspects of it could also give some pause. So we'll carefully wade
through how to interpret this report.

## Data Categories in the Column Summary Table

On the left side of the table are icons of different colors. These represent categories that the
columns fall into. There are only five categories and columns can only be of one type. The
categories (and their letter marks) are:

- `N`: numeric
- `S`: string-based
- `D`: date/datetime
- `T/F`: boolean
- `O`: object

The numeric category (`N`) takes data types such as floats and integers. The `S` category is for
string-based columns. Date or datetime values are lumped into the `D` category. Boolean columns
(`T/F`) have their own category and are *not* considered numeric (e.g., `0`/`1`). The `O` category
is a catchall for all other types of columns. Given the disparity of these categories and that we
want them in the same table, some statistical measures will be sensible for certain column
categories but not for others. Given that, we'll explain how each category is represented in the
column summary table.

## Numeric Data

Three columns in `small_table` are numeric: `a` (`Int64`), `c` (`Int64`), and `d` (`Float64`). The
common measures of the missing count/proportion (`NA`) and the unique value count/proportion (`UQ`)
are provided for the numeric data type. For these two measures, the top number is the absolute count
of missing values and the count of unique values. The bottom number is a proportion of the absolute
count divided by the row count; this makes each proportion a value between `0` and `1` (bounds
included).

The next two columns represent the mean (`Mean`) and the standard deviation (`SD`). The minumum
(`Min`), maximum, (`Max`) and a set of quantiles occupy the next few columns (includes `P5`, `Q1`,
`Med` for median, `Q3`, and `P95`). Finally, the interquartile range (`IQR`: `Q3` - `Q1`) is the
last measure provided.

## String Data

String data is present in `small_table`, being in columns `b` and `f`. The missing value (`NA`) and
uniqueness (`UQ`) measures are accounted for here. The statistical measures are all based on string
lengths, so what happens is that all strings in a column are converted to those numeric values and a
subset of stats values is presented. To avoid some understandable confusion when reading the table,
the stats values in each of the cells with values are annotated with the text `"SL"`. It makes less
sense to provide a full suite of quantile values so only the minimum (`Min`), median (`Med`), and
maximum (`Max`) are provided.

## Date/Datetime Data and Boolean Data

We see that in the first two rows of our summary table there are summaries of the `date_time` and
`date` columns. The summaries we provide for a date/datetime category (notice the green `D` to the
left of the column names) are:

1. the missing count/proportion (`NA`)
2. the unique value count/proportion (`UQ`)
3. the minimum and maximum dates/datetimes

One column, `e`, is of the `Boolean` type. Because columns of this type could only have `True`,
`False`, or missing values, we provide summary data for missingness (under `NA`) and proportions of
`True` and `False` values (under `UQ`).
