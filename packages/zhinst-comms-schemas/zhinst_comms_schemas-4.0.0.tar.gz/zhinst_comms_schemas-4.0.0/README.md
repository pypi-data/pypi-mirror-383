# Zurich Instruments Capnp Schemas

The `zhinst.comms_schemas` package contains the precompiled schemas for different 
capnp servers

> [!CAUTION]
> This API package is solely being developed to support [LabOne Q](https://www.zhinst.com/quantum-computing-systems/labone-q), the software framework for quantum computing.
>
> For direct access to the instruments without LabOne Q, the standard Python API for all Zurich Instruments' devices is provided through the `zhinst` package and can be obtained from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/zhinst/) by `pip install zhinst`.
