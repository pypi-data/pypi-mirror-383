    Controls the magnitude of the low-rank approximation. A higher alpha value

    the adaptation's impact, ensuring neither underfitting nor overfitting. This is

    """Target specific layers in the model architecture to apply LoRA.

    We select a subset of the layers by default. However, specific layers can also
    be selected. For example:

    - `linear_qkv`: Apply LoRA to the fused linear layer used for query, key, and
      value projections in self-attention.
    - `linear_proj`: Apply LoRA to the linear layer used for projecting the output
      of self-attention.
    - `linear_fc1`: Apply LoRA to the first fully-connected layer in MLP.
    - `linear_fc2`: Apply LoRA to the second fully-connected layer in MLP.
    - `*_proj`: Apply LoRA to all layers used for projecting the output of
      self-attention. Target modules can also contain wildcards. For example, you
      can specify
      `target_modules=['*.layers.0.*.linear_qkv', '*.layers.1.*.linear_qkv']` to add
      LoRA to only linear_qkv on the first two layers.

    Our framework only supports a Fused LoRA implementation, Cannonical LoRA is not
    supported.
