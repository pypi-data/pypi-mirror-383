        Completion for the provided conversation.

        Args:
          model: The model to use for completion. Must be one of the available models.

          best_of: Not supported. Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best"
              (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be
              streamed. When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions
              and n specifies how many to return - best_of must be greater than n.

          echo: Not supported. If `echo` is true, the response will include the prompt and
              optionally its tokens ids and logprobs.

          frequency_penalty: Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the
              text.

          function_call: Not Supported. Deprecated in favor of tool_choice. 'none' means the model will
              not call a function and instead generates a message. 'auto' means the model can
              pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular
              function via {'name': 'my_function'} forces the model to call that function.

          ignore_eos: Ignore the eos when running

          logit_bias: Not Supported. Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the
              completion.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of
              message

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message.

          presence_penalty: Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so
              far.

          prompt: User prompt or list of token ids.

          response_format: Format of the response, can be 'json_object' to force the model to output valid
              JSON.

          seed: If specified, attempts to sample deterministically.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

          stream: If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT.

          suffix: Not supported. If echo is set, the prompt is returned with the completion.

          system_fingerprint: Represents the backend configuration that the model runs with. Used with seed
              for determinism.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2.

          tool_choice: Not Supported. Favored over function_call. Controls which (if any) function is
              called by the model.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call.

          top_logprobs: The number of most likely tokens to return at each token position.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling.

          user: Not Supported. A unique identifier representing your end-user.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

        Completion for the provided conversation.

        Args:
          model: The model to use for completion. Must be one of the available models.

          best_of: Not supported. Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best"
              (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be
              streamed. When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions
              and n specifies how many to return - best_of must be greater than n.

          echo: Not supported. If `echo` is true, the response will include the prompt and
              optionally its tokens ids and logprobs.

          frequency_penalty: Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the
              text.

          function_call: Not Supported. Deprecated in favor of tool_choice. 'none' means the model will
              not call a function and instead generates a message. 'auto' means the model can
              pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular
              function via {'name': 'my_function'} forces the model to call that function.

          ignore_eos: Ignore the eos when running

          logit_bias: Not Supported. Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the
              completion.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of
              message

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message.

          presence_penalty: Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so
              far.

          prompt: User prompt or list of token ids.

          response_format: Format of the response, can be 'json_object' to force the model to output valid
              JSON.

          seed: If specified, attempts to sample deterministically.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

          stream: If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT.

          suffix: Not supported. If echo is set, the prompt is returned with the completion.

          system_fingerprint: Represents the backend configuration that the model runs with. Used with seed
              for determinism.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2.

          tool_choice: Not Supported. Favored over function_call. Controls which (if any) function is
              called by the model.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call.

          top_logprobs: The number of most likely tokens to return at each token position.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling.

          user: Not Supported. A unique identifier representing your end-user.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request
