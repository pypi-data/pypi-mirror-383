        ```python
        from logly import logger
        debug_logger = logger(internal_debug=True, debug_log_path="logly_debug.log")
        # ... your code that reproduces the issue ...
        ```
        
        Then paste the contents of `logly_debug.log` below, or attach the file to this issue.
      placeholder: |
        Paste your debug log contents here...
