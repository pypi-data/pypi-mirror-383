    """
    Find optimal periods in a price sequence based on cost and timing constraints.

    This algorithm selects periods (indices) from a price sequence to minimize cost
    while satisfying various timing constraints. The primary selection criterion is
    the price threshold - all periods with prices at or below the threshold are
    automatically selected regardless of other constraints.

    Args:
        prices: Sequence of prices for each period. Each element represents the
               price for one time period (e.g., hourly, 15-minute intervals).
        low_price_threshold: Price threshold below/equal to which periods are
                           automatically selected. All periods with price <= threshold
                           will be included in the result regardless of other constraints.
        min_selections: Minimum number of individual periods (indices) that must be
                       selected. The algorithm will select at least this many periods,
                       but may select more if they are below the price threshold.
        min_consecutive_selections: Minimum number of consecutive periods that must be
                                  selected together. Any selected period must be part of
                                  a run of at least this many consecutive selections.
                                  Prevents isolated single-period selections.
        max_gap_between_periods: Maximum number of periods allowed between selected
                               periods. Controls the maximum downtime between operating
                               periods. Set to 0 to require consecutive selections only.
        max_gap_from_start: Maximum number of periods from the beginning before the
                          first selection must occur. Controls how long we can wait
                          before starting operations.

    Returns:
        List of indices representing the selected periods, sorted by price (cheapest first).
        The indices correspond to positions in the input prices sequence.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input parameters are invalid or no valid combination
                   can be found that satisfies all constraints.

    Examples:
        >>> prices = [Decimal('0.05'), Decimal('0.08'), Decimal('0.12'), Decimal('0.06')]
        >>> get_cheapest_periods(prices, Decimal('0.10'), 2, 1, 1, 1)
        [0, 3, 1]  # Selects periods 0, 1, 3 (all <= 0.10, sorted by price)

    Note:
        The algorithm prioritizes periods below the price threshold. If all periods
        are below the threshold, all periods will be selected regardless of other
        constraints. If the desired number of periods equals the total number of
        periods, all periods will be selected regardless of price.
