# McCabe++ (mcpp)

<img src="https://github.com/LPirch/mcpp/blob/master/media/mcpp.jpeg?raw=true" height=400/>

`mcpp` measures typical code complexity metrics like McCabe's cyclomatic
complexity.

The goal of this project is to provide a re-usable script to analyze C/C++
source code and extract complexity metrics from it. The implemented metrics
are taken from the [paper](https://xiaoningdu.github.io/assets/pdf/leopard.pdf)

> LEOPARD: Identifying Vulnerable Code for Vulnerability Assessment through Program Metrics  

This tool is released as part of our research in vulnerability discovery and 
has been used in our paper

> SoK: Where to Fuzz? Assessing Target Selection Methods in Directed Fuzzing" 

See also the corresponding [repo](https://github.com/wsbrg/crashminer).

## Setup

Build a docker container which performs the setup automatically or run the
installation on your local machine:

```sh
pip install .
```

> Note: It is recommended to install packages in virtual environments.


## Usage

### From Python

Simply import `mcpp` and then use the extract function (or one of its variants).

```python
from pathlib import Path
from mcpp import extract

input_dir = Path("some/dir")
in_files = list(input_dir.glob("**/*.c"))
result = extract(in_files)

# to extract only a subset of the metrics
result = extract(in_files, ["V1", "C3"])

# full list of metrics:
from mcpp import METRICS
print(list(METRICS.keys()))
```


### CLI

Configuration parameters can be changed in `config.yaml` or directly on the CLI
with e.g. `mcpp paths.out_root=some/dir`.

Using all defaults:
```sh
mcpp                # with default params like input directory, see config.yaml
```

Changing params from command line:
```sh
mcpp in_path=/some/dir/single_source out_path=single_source_metrics.json
mcpp metrics=\[C1,C2,V4\]
```

Or by passing a changed `config.yaml`:
- `-cp` (config_path) specifies the absolute path to the directory where the config file is located
- `-cn` (config_name) specifies the name of the config file
```sh
mcpp -cp /some/other/dir -cn myconfig.yaml
```

Try out the example:

```sh
mcpp in_path=examples/data/source paths.out_root=examples/data-out
cat examples/data-out/complexity.json
```
