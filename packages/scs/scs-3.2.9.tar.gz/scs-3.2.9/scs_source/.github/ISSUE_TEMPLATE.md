If you are have a problem that SCS struggles with you can pass a string to the
`write_data_filename` argument and SCS will dump a file containing the problem
to disk. Zip the file and send it to us or attach it to this bug report for easy
reproduction of the issue.

A common cause of issues is not linking BLAS/LAPACK libraries correctly. If you
are having this issue please search for resources on installing and linking
these libraries first. You can try openblas if you need a BLAS library.
