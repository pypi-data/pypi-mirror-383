Install SCS via the Julia package manager:

.. code:: julia

  import Pkg
  Pkg.add("SCS")

This will install the `SCS.jl <https://github.com/jump-dev/SCS.jl>`_
package, along with the necessary SCS binary for your system.

For instructions on how to use a custom version of SCS, consult the
`SCS.jl README <https://github.com/jump-dev/SCS.jl>`_.

Note that SCS.jl is a third-party package maintained by the 
`JuMP-dev community <https://jump.dev/pages/governance/>`_.
