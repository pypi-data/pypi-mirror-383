    "# Ensemble Learning with Annealing (QBoost)\n",
    "\n",
    "[QBoost](https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0416) is one of the ensemble learning with quantum annealing(QA).\n",
    "Ensemble learning is a method that prepares a large number of weak predictors and combines the predictions of each of the predictors to obtain a final accurate prediction result."
   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "## Overview and Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "QBoost is an algorithm whose goal is to accurately identify the nature of the input signal $\\boldsymbol{x}$.\n",
    "Let us consider the problem of which of the two values $\\pm 1$ should be assigned to the input signal.\n",
    "As an example, imagine a task where $\\boldsymbol{x}$ represents image data and we want to identify whether what we see in the image is a dog or a cat.\n",
    "In ensemble learning, the goal is to achieve better prediction accuracy (boosting) by using multiple predictors.\n",
    "Here, we have many predictors that do not perform well (weak predictors).\n",
    "Note that by poorly performing, it means that they often do not produce correct outputs for their inputs.\n",
    "Let the output of these predictors be $c_i (\\boldsymbol{x}) \\in \\{ -1, 1\\} \\ (i=0, 1, \\dots, N-1)$.\n",
    "The basic idea is that by summing the outputs of several weak predictors, we can make better predictions.\n",
    "This can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C(\\boldsymbol{x}) \n",
    "= \\mathrm{sgn} \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} w_i c_i (\\boldsymbol{x}) \\right) \n",
    "$$(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "$w_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ indicates whether the $i$th predictor is used or not.\n",
    "Let us identify which predictor gives better performance with as few weak predictors as possible.\n",
    "We will use supervised learning to find the optimal $\\{w_i\\}$ pairs.\n",
    "We have a large number of $(\\boldsymbol{x}^{(d)}, y^{(d)}) \\ (d= 0, 1, \\dots, D-1)$ of supervised data ($D \\gg 1$), and we adjust $\\{w_i\\}$ to reproduce them as closely as possible.\n",
    "In other words, we aim to minimize the following Hamiltonian for $\\{w_i\\}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H(\\boldsymbol{w}) = \\sum_{d=0}^{D-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} w_i c_i (\\boldsymbol{x}^{(d)}) - y^{(d)}\\right)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} w_i \n",
    "$$ (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this minimization of the Hamiltonian, the difference from the supervised data $y^{(d)}$ is made as small as possible.\n",
    "If we use the right-hand side of equation (1) as it is, it cannot come down to the Ising model because it is not a quadratic form of $w_i$ due to the sign function.\n",
    "Therefore, the problem is made to minimize the square of the difference between the $1/N$ times the sign function argument $\\sum_i w_i c_i$ and the supervised data $y^{(d)}$.\n",
    "The coefficient of $1/N$ is to adjust the maximum value of $\\sum_i w_i c_i(\\boldsymbol{x})$ to be $N$ so that the difference between $y^{(d)}= \\pm 1$ is not too large.\n",
    "The term with $\\lambda (>0)$ applied represents the regularization term to efficiently construct a relatively small number of weak predictors without setting too many $w_i$ to 1."
