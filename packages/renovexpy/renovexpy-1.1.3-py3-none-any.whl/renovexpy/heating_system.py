"""
Simulate a heat pump and gas boiler as follows:
    1) Load simulation data from E+. This includes hourly outdoor temperature and
    heating demand.
    2) Optional: Compute the heating demand at design temperature (-10 °C), and
    size the radiator area to meet this demand. Otherwise, use the provided
    radiator area.
    3) Compute the temperature needed in radiators to meet the heating demand, and
    the corresponding supply and return flow temperatures.
    4) Compute the efficiency of the gas boiler / heatpump.
    5) Compute the hourly gas consumption of the boiler.
    6) Compute the maximum load of the heat pump based on the outdoor temperature
    and flow temperature.
    7) Compute the hourly electricity consumption of the heat pump, and the part of
    the heating demand covered by the electric backup.
    8) Save the results to an output file.
