# | PySpaceAPI Wrapper! ðŸš€

PySpaceAPI is a fairly thin
(for now at least) API
wrapper, which aims to provide
some more ease when it
comes to retrieving astronomical data
from available public APIs! The
goal is to add support
for all, if not as
many endpoints as possible that
fall within the scope of
astronomical data. And possibly in
the future add more functionality
to the wrapper to achieve
more than simply retrieving data
and returning it as a
python dict, as well as
adding support for multiple other
non-NASA APIs!

Currently, this wrapper contains **nineteen**
endpoints (out of the many
planned) from NASA, but there
will be more in the
future!

## | Currently Supported Endpoints:

> [!NOTE]
> 
> *Most explanations and in-depth documentation
> seen here are provided by 
> the [**official NASA APIs page**](https://api.nasa.gov)*.

### [**The Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker**](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov) (EONET)

"The Earth Observatory Natural Event
Tracker (EONET) is a prototype
web service with the goal
of:

providing a curated source of
continuously updated natural event metadata;
providing a service that links
those natural events to thematically-related
web service-enabled image sources (e.g., via WMS, WMTS, etc.)."

  - [**Events**](https://github.com/Py-Kat/py-space-api/blob/d2e1f2e4bef5e9aef19d35876546a359ee38f0d9/pyspaceapi/nasa.py#L630)
    - Retrieve Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET)
    events with up to eleven optional parameters. Such as: Source,
    category, status, limit, days, time frame, magnitude IDs
    and values, and a bounding box!


  - [**Events GeoJSON**](https://github.com/Py-Kat/py-space-api/blob/d2e1f2e4bef5e9aef19d35876546a359ee38f0d9/pyspaceapi/nasa.py#L737)
    - Retrieve Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET)
    GeoJSON events with up to eleven optional parameters. Such as:
    Source, category, status, limit, days, time frame, magnitude IDs
    and values, and a bounding box!


  - [**Categories**](https://github.com/Py-Kat/py-space-api/blob/d2e1f2e4bef5e9aef19d35876546a359ee38f0d9/pyspaceapi/nasa.py#L844)
    - "Categories are the types of events by which individual
    events are cataloged. Categories can be used to filter
    the output of the Categories API and the Layers API.
    The acceptable categories can be accessed via the [**categories JSON**](https://eonet.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/v3/categories)."


  - [**Layers**](https://github.com/Py-Kat/py-space-api/blob/d2e1f2e4bef5e9aef19d35876546a359ee38f0d9/pyspaceapi/nasa.py#L919)
    - "A Layer is a reference to a specific web service
      (e.g., WMS, WMTS) that can be used to produce imagery
      of a particular NASA data parameter. Layers are mapped
      to categories within EONET to provide a category-specific
      list of layers (e.g., the â€˜Volcanoesâ€™ category is mapped
      to layers that can provide imagery in true color, SO2,
      aerosols, etc.). Web services come in a variety of flavors,
      so it is not possible to include all of the necessary metadata
      here that is required to construct a properly-formulated request
      (URL). The full list of layers can be accessed via the [**layers JSON**](https://eonet.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/v3/layers)."

## | Installing The Package:

This package can be installed
via PIP or installed manually
via the release downloads on
GitHub!

Due to a conflict with
an apparent non-existent package on
PyPI, the installation name is
*slightly* different than the one
used for everything else.

PIP Install:
```
shell

pip install pyspaceapis
```

Manual Install:
```
shell

pip install "PATH\TO\pyspaceapis-0.4.0-py3-none-any.whl"
```

Dependencies can be viewed on
[**Line #8 in 'pyproject.toml'**](pyproject.toml).

## | Using The Package:

As noted above, this wrapper
is very much so in
the early stages and supports
just 19 NASA API endpoints
at the moment. However, I
am working to constantly and
consistently add more!

All methods currently return a
python dict. This will be
changed if it is found
to be a problem, or
an annoyance for users. However,
I have not found a
reason to do so yet.

To access these, input your
NASA API key or leave
the parameter empty to use
the NASA Demo Key.

```
python

from pyspaceapi import NASAClient


# This uses the Demo Key by default
client = NASAClient()
```

After this, you are ready
to make requests to the
NASA endpoints!

### Example API Request:

*This program will search the
NASA Astronomy Picture of the
Day endpoint and return a
python dict containing the data
of a single random APOD
entry!*

```
python

from pyspaceapi import NASAClient


# Replace 'DEMO_KEY' if you plan to use your own NASA API key!
client = NASAClient("DEMO_KEY")

# Get one random APOD entry
data = client.apod(count=1)
print(data)
```

The program will then return
and print a dict containing
the retrieved data!

The output:

```
console

[{'copyright': '\n\nJohannes Schedler\n(Panther Observatory)\n\n', 'date': '2005-06-07', 'explanation': 'Galaxies abound in this cosmic scene, a well chosen telescopic view toward the northern constellation of Ursa Major. Most noticeable are the striking pair of spiral galaxies - NGC 3718 (above, right) and NGC 3729 (below center) - a mere 52 million light-years distant. In particular, NGC 3718 has dramatic dust lanes sweeping through its bright central region and extensive but faint spiral arms. Seen about 150 thousand light-years apart, these two galaxies are likely interacting gravitationally, accounting for the warped and peculiar appearance of NGC 3718. While a careful study of the deep image reveals a number of fainter and more distant background galaxies, another remarkable galaxy grouping known as Hickson Group 56 can be found just to the right of NGC 3718. Hickson Group 56 contains five interacting galaxies and lies over 400 million light-years away.', 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0506/ngc3718etc_schedler_full.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Galaxies in View', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0506/ngc3718etc_schedler_c38.jpg'}]

### Debug Tools:

Along with the endpoint methods,
I have included another separate
module named: '[**debugtools**](https://github.com/Py-Kat/py-space-api/blob/1e1725859abd83743531d76eb4d592371f675054/pyspaceapi/debugtools.py)' which contains
just one tool for now,
being the '[**time_this**](https://github.com/Py-Kat/py-space-api/blob/1e1725859abd83743531d76eb4d592371f675054/pyspaceapi/debugtools.py#L5)' decorator!

Usage would appear something
like this:

```
python

from pyspaceapi.debugtools import time_this
from time import sleep


@time_this
def do_something():
    sleep(1.7)
    print("Did something!")


do_something()
```

The output:

```
console

Did something!


(Finished in: 1.7000 seconds.)
```

# | Final Notes:

Since this package/wrapper is still
very early, please expect there
to possibly be some bugs
or other weirdness! If anything
of the like is noticed
in which you'd like fixed,
or you have any suggestions,
please be sure to make
a submission in the GitHub
repository, and I will attempt
to make implementations as soon
as possible!
