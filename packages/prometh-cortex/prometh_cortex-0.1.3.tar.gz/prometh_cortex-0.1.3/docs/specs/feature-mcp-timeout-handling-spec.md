# Feature Specification: MCP Timeout Handling Solutions

## 1. Feature Summary

### Brief Overview and Business Value
Implement comprehensive timeout handling mechanisms for the Prometh-Cortex MCP server to prevent MCP error 32001 (request timeout) during long-running operations. This enhancement ensures reliable Claude Desktop integration by maintaining connection stability during complex queries and index operations that exceed the default 60-second timeout limit.

### Clear Problem Statement
The current MCP server implementation experiences timeout failures when:
- **Server startup** takes longer than 50 seconds during initialization
- Large document queries take >60 seconds to process
- Index loading operations exceed timeout limits during cold starts
- Complex semantic searches with full content loading cause connection drops
- Vector similarity calculations on large datasets overwhelm the 60s limit

**Reference**: [MCP Timeout Solutions Guide](https://mcpcat.io/guides/fixing-mcp-error-32001-request-timeout/)

### Success Metrics
- **Startup Performance**: MCP server initialization completes in <50 seconds
- **Availability**: Achieve 99.9% query success rate for operations <5 minutes
- **Performance**: Maintain <2s response time for progress notifications
- **Reliability**: Zero timeout errors for queries processing <1000 documents
- **User Experience**: Clear progress feedback for operations >10 seconds

## 2. User Stories

### Primary User Personas and Their Needs

#### Claude Desktop User (End User)
**Story**: As a Claude Desktop user querying large document sets, I want reliable responses without timeout errors so I can access information from extensive knowledge bases.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Receive progress updates every 5 seconds for long-running queries
- [ ] Get partial results if query exceeds reasonable time limits
- [ ] Clear error messages when operations genuinely fail (not timeout)
- [ ] Ability to cancel long-running operations

**Priority**: Must-have

#### System Administrator (DevOps)
**Story**: As a system administrator, I want configurable timeout settings and monitoring so I can optimize the system for different deployment scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Environment-based timeout configuration
- [ ] Health check endpoint reports timeout statistics
- [ ] Logging and metrics for timeout events
- [ ] Graceful degradation under high load

**Priority**: Should-have

#### Developer/Integrator (Technical User)
**Story**: As a developer integrating with the MCP server, I want predictable behavior and debugging capabilities for timeout scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Well-documented timeout behavior in API responses
- [ ] Debug modes with extended timeout limits
- [ ] Clear separation between user-facing and system timeouts
- [ ] Integration test coverage for timeout scenarios

**Priority**: Should-have

## 3. Technical Requirements

### Startup Performance Requirements
- **Maximum Startup Time**: MCP server must be ready to accept connections within 50 seconds
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement deferred index loading to reduce initial startup time
- **Startup Progress**: Report initialization progress to prevent client timeout during startup
- **Health Check**: Provide `/health` endpoint that responds during startup with initialization status
- **Configuration Validation**: Front-load all configuration validation to fail fast

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks with Mitigation Strategies

#### High Risk: MCP Protocol Compatibility
**Risk**: Timeout handling modifications break MCP protocol compliance
**Impact**: Claude Desktop integration failure
**Mitigation Strategy**: 
- Implement timeout features as optional extensions
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing MCP tools
- Extensive testing with Claude Desktop client
- Fallback to original behavior if enhanced features fail

#### Medium Risk: Performance Degradation
**Risk**: Progress reporting and chunking overhead slows normal queries  
**Impact**: Reduced system performance for typical use cases
**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Make progress reporting opt-in for fast queries
- Profile and optimize progress update mechanisms
- Use lightweight async operations
- Implement performance regression tests

#### Medium Risk: Memory Usage Inflation
**Risk**: Long-running operations and result caching increase memory usage
**Impact**: System instability or resource exhaustion
**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement aggressive cleanup of completed operations
- Use streaming for large result sets
- Add memory usage monitoring and alerts
- Configure operation TTL limits

#### Low Risk: Configuration Complexity
**Risk**: Multiple timeout settings create confusion
**Impact**: Difficult deployment and troubleshooting
**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Provide sensible defaults for all timeout settings
- Create configuration validation and help tools
- Document common timeout scenarios and solutions
- Implement configuration testing utilities

### Dependencies and Blockers

#### External Dependencies
- **FastMCP Framework**: Must support custom timeout handling
- **Claude Desktop**: Must properly handle progress notifications
- **LlamaIndex/FAISS**: Must support chunked/streaming operations
- **Python asyncio**: Requires stable async operation management

#### Internal Blockers
- **Current MCP Server Stability**: Must resolve existing issues before enhancement
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Need timeout simulation capabilities  
- **Documentation**: Requires comprehensive timeout handling documentation
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Must support new configuration parameters

### Success/Failure Criteria

#### Success Criteria
- **Zero timeout errors** for queries <300 seconds duration
- **Sub-2-second progress updates** for all long-running operations  
- **Backward compatibility** maintained with existing MCP clients
- **Performance impact <10%** for typical query workloads
- **Memory usage increase <20%** under normal operation

#### Failure Criteria
- **>5% timeout error rate** for standard query workloads
- **Progress update delays >10 seconds** causing user confusion
- **Breaking changes** requiring client code modifications
- **Performance degradation >25%** for existing functionality
- **Memory leaks** or unbounded resource consumption

#### Go/No-Go Decision Points
1. **After Phase 1**: Progress notifications work reliably with <2s response time
2. **After Phase 2**: Chunked processing shows <10% performance impact  
3. **After Phase 3**: Async operations handle at least 10 concurrent queries
4. **Before Production**: Full integration testing passes with Claude Desktop

This comprehensive specification provides the foundation for implementing robust timeout handling in the Prometh-Cortex MCP server, ensuring reliable operation with large document sets and complex queries while maintaining the performance and simplicity that users expect.
