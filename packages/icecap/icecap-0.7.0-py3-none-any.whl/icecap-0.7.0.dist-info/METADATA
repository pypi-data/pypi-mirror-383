IceCap is a Python library for building World of Warcraft assistant applications. It provides a set of utilities to interact with the game, automate tasks, and enhance the gaming experience.

The library is specifically designed for **WoW 3.3.5a (build 1340)** and will not work with other versions of the game.

---

## Features

- **Memory Management**: Read and write to the game's memory to access and manipulate game data
- **Entities as Objects**: Interact with game entities (players, units, game objects) as Python objects
- **Game assets management**: Access MPQ archives programmatically 
- **Less Boilerplate**: Designed to minimize boilerplate code
