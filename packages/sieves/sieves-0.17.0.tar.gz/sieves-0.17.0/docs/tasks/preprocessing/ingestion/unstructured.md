# unstructured

Note: This task depends on optional ingestion libraries that are not installed by default. Install them with the ingestion extra, or install the specific library directly if you prefer.

Examples:

```bash
pip install "sieves[ingestion]"          # installs ingestion deps via extra
# or install the library directly
pip install unstructured                  # choose extras as needed
```
