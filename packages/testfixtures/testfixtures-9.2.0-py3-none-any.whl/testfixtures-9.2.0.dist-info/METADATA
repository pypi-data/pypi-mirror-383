Testfixtures is a collection of helpers and mock objects that are useful when
writing automated tests in Python.

The areas of testing this package can help with are listed below:

**Comparing objects and sequences**

Better feedback when the results aren't as you expected along with
support for comparison of objects that don't normally support
comparison and comparison of deeply nested datastructures.

**Mocking out objects and methods**

Easy to use ways of stubbing out objects, classes or individual
methods. Specialised helpers and mock objects are provided, including sub-processes,
dates and times.

**Testing logging**

Helpers for capturing logging and checking what has been logged is what was expected.

**Testing stream output**

Helpers for capturing stream output, such as that from print function calls or even
stuff written directly to file descriptors, and making assertions about it.

**Testing with files and directories**

Support for creating and checking both files and directories in sandboxes
including support for other common path libraries.

**Testing exceptions and warnings**

Easy to use ways of checking that a certain exception is raised,
or a warning is issued, even down the to the parameters provided.

**Testing when using django**

Helpers for comparing instances of django models.

**Testing when using Twisted**

Helpers for making assertions about logging when using Twisted.
