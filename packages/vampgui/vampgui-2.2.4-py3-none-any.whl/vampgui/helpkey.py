Material 1 could be allocated to this site using material[1]:unit-cell-category =1, and a second material could be allocated to the second site using material[2]:unit-cell-category = 2.

The system is usually simulated with constant temperature and applied field. The system is first equilibrated for sim:equilibration-time-steps time steps and is then integrated for sim:time-steps time steps.\n\n sim:program=hysteresis-loop :\nProgram to simulate a dynamic hysteresis loop in user defined field range and precision. The system temperature is fixed and defined by sim:temperature. The system is first equilibrated for sim:equilibration time-steps time steps at sim:maximum-applied-field-strength applied field. For normal loops sim:maximum-applied-field-strength should be a saturating field. After equilibration the system is integrated for sim:loop-time-steps at each field point.

At each field increment the system is integrated until either the maximum torque for any one spin is less than the tolerance value (10−6 T), or if sim:loop-time-steps is reached. Generally static loops are computationally efficient, and so sim:loop-time-steps can be large, as many integration steps are only required during switching, i.e. near the coercivity.\n\n sim:program=curie-temperature \n Simulates a temperature loop to determine the Curie temperature of the system. The temperature of the system is increased stepwise, starting at sim:minimum temperature and ending at  sim:maximum-temperature in steps of sim:temperature-increment. At each temperature the system is first equilibrated for sim:equilibration-steps time steps and then a statistical average is taken over sim:loop-time-steps. In general the Monte Carlo integrator is the optimal method for determining the Curie temperature, and typically a few thousand steps is sufficient to equilibrate the system. To determine the Curie temperature it is best to plot the mean magnetization length at each temperature, which can be specified using the output:mean-magnetisation-length keyword.

The system is first equilibrated at constant temperature with zero voltage. A trapezium shaped electrical pulse is applied, linearly increasing from zero voltage to that defined in the code, held constant, then linearly decreased back to zero. In the case of direct STT and SOT simulations, the effective fields are scaled in direct proportion with the applied voltage. The pulse duration is controlled by the parameter sim:electrical-pulse-time with a rise time of sim:electrical-pulse-rise-time and fall time of sim:electrical-pulse-fall-time. The default pulse time is 1 ns, and default fall and rise times are 0, reproducing a square pulse.

The margin between the edge of the system and the written tracks in cross-track is specified via hamr:track-padding, while hamr:NPS/hamr:NFT-to-pole-spacing set the shift between the centre of application of the external field and temperature pulse."
