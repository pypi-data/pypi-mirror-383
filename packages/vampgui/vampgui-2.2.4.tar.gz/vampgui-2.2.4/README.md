# VAMPgui – Interface to VAMPIRE 7

**VAMPgui** is a graphical user interface written in Python 3 using the `tkinter` library. It is designed to simplify the use of the VAMPIRE
atomistic spin dynamics code [VAMPIRE - Atomistic Spin Dynamics](https://vampire.york.ac.uk/). The GUI has been tested on Linux systems including **Ubuntu 20.04** and **Ubuntu 24.04**.
