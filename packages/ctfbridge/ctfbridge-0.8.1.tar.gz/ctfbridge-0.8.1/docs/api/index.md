# API Overview

Welcome to the API reference section of **CTFBridge**. This section documents the public interface for interacting with CTF platforms through the unified `ctfbridge` client. It is intended for developers integrating CTFBridge into their own automation or analysis workflows.

---

## üîß API Structure

CTFBridge exposes its functionality through a centralized `client` object created using the `create_client()` function. This object provides access to service modules grouped by functionality:

| Client Attribute     | Description                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `client.auth`        | Handles login, logout, and session validation.     |
| `client.challenges`  | Lists, filters, retrieves, and submits challenges. |
| `client.attachments` | Downloads challenge-related files.                 |
| `client.scoreboard`  | Views the top teams or users.                      |
| `client.session`     | Manages cookies and session helpers.               |

Each of these modules is implemented as a **service class** (e.g. `AuthService`, `ChallengeService`) and can be interacted with using clean, typed Python methods.

## üèÅ Getting Started with the Client

```python
import asyncio
from ctfbridge import create_client

async def main():
    client = await create_client("https://demo.ctfd.io")
    await client.auth.login(username="admin", password="password")

    challenges = await client.challenges.get_all()
    for chal in challenges:
        print(chal.category, chal.name, chal.value)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

---

## üì¶ Models

All returned data is strongly typed using structured Python classes defined in `ctfbridge.models`. Some key models include:

- `Challenge`
- `Submission`
- `ScoreboardEntry`
- `User`

These help ensure consistent structure and enable IDE auto-completion and static analysis.

## üß† Notes for Developers

- All services follow a consistent structure and interface.
- Internally, platform-specific behavior is abstracted away behind the scenes.
- You should generally not need to care whether you're working with CTFd, HTB, rCTF, etc.

For detailed usage of each API component, see the individual reference pages in this section:
