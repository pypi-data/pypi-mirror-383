This is a small, pure-Python library providing statistical tools for online monitoring
and analysis of experimental data, with a focus on histogramming, time series, and
fitting. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it suitable for
integration into existing data processing pipelines.

The :doc:`example gallery <auto_examples/index>` is probably the best place to start.
Have fun!
