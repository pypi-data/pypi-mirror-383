The [*WaterBenchmarkHub*](https://waterfutures.github.io/WaterBenchmarkHub) is a platform for
accessing and sharing Water Distribution Network (WDN) benchmarks and data sets.
The webpage is available at
[https://waterfutures.github.io/WaterBenchmarkHub](https://waterfutures.github.io/WaterBenchmarkHub)
-- see [docs/](docs/) for details such as source code, etc.

The availability and accessibility of benchmarks are essential for reproducible research as well as
for accelerating scientific progress.
A benchmark is a *verified* data set or resource (e.g. a water distribution network) together with an
evaluation functions that can evaluate different algorithms/methods under the same criteria.

The WaterBenchmarkHub is also available as a Python package *water-benchmark-hub*.

## Call for Contributions

If you have a benchmark (resource) that is not yet available in the *WaterBenchmarkHub*,
please either create a new issue or read on
[How to Contribute](https://waterbenchmarkhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_contribute.html).

## Quick Example

```python
from water_benchmark_hub import load


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load the GECCO Water Quality 2019 benchmark
    benchmark = load("GECCO-WaterQuality2019")

    # Load data set
    data = benchmark.load_data(return_X_y=True)

    # Show number of samples
    X_train, y_train = data["train"]
    X_val, y_val = data["validation"]
    X_test, y_test = data["test"]
    print(X_train.shape, X_val.shape, X_test.shape)
```
