"""Document type for Chonkie.

Documents allows chonkie to work together with other libraries that have their own 
document types — ensuring that the transition between libraries is as seamless as possible!

Additionally, documents are used to link together multiple sources of metadata that can be 
leveraged in downstream use-cases. One example of this would be in-line images, which are
stored as base64 encoded strings in the `metadata` field.

Lastly, documents are used by the chunkers to understand that they are working with chunks
of a document and not an assortment of text when dealing with hybrid/dual-mode chunking. 

This class is designed to be extended and might go through significant changes in the future.

    """Document type for Chonkie.
    
    Document allows us to encapsulate a text and its chunks, along with any additional 
    metadata. It becomes essential when dealing with complex chunking use-cases, such
    as dealing with in-line images, tables, or other non-text data. Documents are also 
    useful to give meaning when you want to chunk text that is already chunked, possibly
    with different chunkers.

    Args:
        id: The id of the document. If not provided, a random uuid will be generated.
        text: The complete text of the document.
        chunks: The chunks of the document.
        metadata: Any additional metadata you want to store about the document.
