# Chanty
### Write Minecraft datapacks easely with Python

</div>

**chanty** is a Python DSL for writing Minecraft datapacks as if they were real code.  
No more messy `.mcfunction` files - just cliean, structured logic.


## Features

- **Pythonic Datapack Development**
  Write Minecraft datapack using real Python code instead of raw `.mcfunction` files.
- **Command Builder API**
  Generate complex Minecraft commands (`execute`, `summon`, `scoreboard`, etc.) programmatically and dynamically.
- **Custom Item System**
  Create fully functional custom items with names, lore, events and NBT attributes - all in code.
- **Hot Reloading**
  Automatically rebuild and export your dapatack whenever a Python file changes (you still should to use `/reload` command in game).
- **Automatic Resourcepack Exporting**
  Export resourcepaks as ready-to-import `.zip` archives.


## Install
```shell
pip install chanty
```


## CLI Usage

### Creating Project
```shell
chanty create test-project

cd test-project
```

### Build Datapack
To build and export your datapack, use:
```shell
chanty build MAIN_FILE:PACK_VARIABLE --ARGS
```

Exporting to the default .minecraft saves folder:
```shell
chanty build main:pack --world_name="New World"
```

Exporting to Modrinth App:
```shell
chanty build main:pack --modrinth="ProfileName:New World"
```

Exporting to a custom destination:
```shell
chanty build main:pack --to="./builds/datapack"
```


Exporting to a `./builds/<datapack_name>` folder:
```shell
chanty build main:pack --output="./builds"
```


### Development Mode
You can start the `dev` mode to automatically re-export your datapack every time any `.py` file changes. 

Supported arguments: `--save_folder`, `--world_name`, and `--modrinth`.

```shell
chanty dev main:pack --modrinth="ProfileName:New World"
```


### Up Project
After updating your Chanty version, use:
```shell
chanty up
```
to synchronize your project structure with the latest Chanty template.


## Usage

### Simple example
```py
from chanty import Datapack, Namespace, CommandBuilder

pack = DataPack('my_awesome_datapack')
namespace = Namespace('main')

@namespace.on_load
def handle_on_load() -> str:
    with CommandBuilder() as cmd:
        cmd.tellraw('Hello world from chanty datapack!')
    return cmd.build()


# Export into folder
if __name__ == '__main__':
    pack.export('./my_datapack')
```


### Custom Items
```py
from chanty import DataPack Namespace, CommandBuilder, CustomItem, Item


pack = DataPack('my_awesome_datapack')
namespace = Namespace('main')

my_cool_item = CustomItem(Item.STICK)
my_cool_item.set_name('§6§l[Chanty]§f§r Debugger')
my_cool_item.set_lore(
    'This is a not just stick ...',
    'This is a §6§l[Chanty]§f§r Debugger!',
)
my_cool_item.glint(True)
@my_cool_item.on_right_click
def handle_right_click():
    with CommandBuilder() as cmd:
        cmd.say('Hello!')
    return cmd.build()

namespace.register(my_cool_item)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pack.export('./my_datapack')
```


## In The Future ...

- Asset management
- Achievements
- More built-in event hooks
- CLI improvements
