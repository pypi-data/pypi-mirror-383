def ego_betweenness(G, node):
    """
    ego networks are networks consisting of a single actor (ego) together with the actors they are connected to (alters) and all the links among those alters.[1]
    Burt (1992), in his book Structural Holes, provides ample evidence that having high betweenness centrality, which is highly correlated with having many structural holes, can bring benefits to ego.[1]
    Returns the betweenness centrality of a ego network whose ego is set

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
    node : int

    Returns
    -------
    sum : float
        the betweenness centrality of a ego network whose ego is set

    Examples
    --------
    Returns the betwenness centrality of node 1.
