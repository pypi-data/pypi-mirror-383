MusicRaft
=========

'MusicRaft' is a GUI for the ABC(plus) music notation, built around python and the Qt GUI toolkit.
__*A note regarding this documentation:*__ *The documentation located on my gitlab page
<https://gitlab.com/papahippo/MusicRaft>
 will tend to be more up-to-date than the documentation located on 'the python package index' <https://pypi.org/project/MusicRaft/>*

The following screenshot will, I trust, paint the first thousand words
of documentation:

## Installation

This version of the musicraft package has been validated to work
under Linux, under Windows and under MacOSX. Each of these, however,
can be problematic. The various issues are dealt with
in a separate document: 
[install](./install).

__*A note regarding virtuaL environments:*__
Since the introduction of the [uv tool](https://pypi.org/project/uv/)
(this links to the official python package index,
but tutorial introductions exist elsewhere)
, working
with virtual envronments has become fast and, at least under Linux,
very easy. While I would encourage you to embrace the use of 'uv' also 
for musicraft, I have not yet updated these instructions accordingly.


Musicraft and its dependencies can be installed from
the python package repository.
The exact syntax will vary across platforms but will be something like...

`pip3 install --user musicraft`

... or ...

`python3 -m pip install --user musicraft`

The `--user` is not essential but it avoids permission problems,
 e.g. having to use `sudo` on Linux systems.


__bundled 'command line' tools__

The following 'command line' tools are automatically installed alongside
musicraft into 'share' direcetories...

* `abcm2ps` to derive graphic scores from ABCplus code
* `abcm2midi` to derive midi files from ABCplus code
* `abc2abc` to transpose ABCplus code

... but don't worry, you won't actually have to use these from
the command line! This is handled 'under the surface' by
musicraft.

To keep the setup scripting simple, executables for Linux, Windows
and Mac OSX are all installed, but of course, at run-time only the
appropriate native versions are run.

__bundled Documentation__

I try to keep this README down to size, so that impatient users can
get up and running quickly. Quite a lot of supplentary documentation
gets installed alongside this README in the `doc` subdirectory, inculding an
[index](./INDEX.md).

__Standalone binaries__

Some time ago, I created (using PyInstaller) a standalone executable version  of Musicraft for 64-bit systems under
[Windows](https://gitlab.com/papahippo/MusicRaft/blob/master/dist/win_musicraft.exe) (tested on Windows 10).
**N.B. I haven't recently regenerated this version so particularly the documentation may not match completely.**
 
I have disabled the standalone binary for Linux. (don't ask;
it was a long sad story which I have conveniently forgotten!)

I haven't looked into the desirability or feasibility of a standalone binary version
for Mac OSX but am open to suggestions and guidance.  
 
## Running musicraft

Starting musicraft is a simple matter of ...

`python -m musicraft [options] [abc-source-file-name ...]` 
 
... or ...

`run_musicraft [options] [abc-source-file-name ...]` 
 
If no options are included, musicraft uses the bundled copies of the command-line tools ('abcm2ps' etc.).
This behaviour can be specified explicitly by including optio `-S` or `--share`.

Conversely, in order to use versions of the these tools which were present on your system before
musicraft was installed, include the option `-X` or `--external`.

It is possible to associate musicraft (and desired options)  with all `.abc` files so that a 
double-click on such a file in the file manager is sufficient to start
musicraft. How to do this depends on the operating system context; perhaps
this will be (semi)- automated in later releases of the musicraft
package.

By clicking on the tabs `abc2abc` `abc2midi` `abcm2ps` `ps2pdf`
and `abcm2svg` of the`error/diagnostic output` panel you can check whether musicraft
is finding and executing the 'command line tools' properly. If not, 
you can find the version of these tools for your system from
the sites listed  under __ABCplus music notation__ below. After doing this, you omit
the`-S` when starting musicraft and it will use your specially installed versions,

Two alternative start-up scripts are also included.
These illustrate how, with a little python knowledge,
one can adjust ('tweak') the behaviour of musicraft:

* `musicraft_custom.py` customizes the PDF output filename to include the current date.
* `musicraft_cello.py` customizes extra
[keyboard snippets](##### keyboard snippets) (see below!).

Both of the above also contain a number of disabled customizations for
illustration purposes.
 

#### Debugging

Musicraft writes some 'on the go' diagnostic information to the `System` tab of
the `error/diagnostic` panel. Actual error oinformation (more properly:
information written to `stderr` as opposed to `stdout`) is written
in italics.

On the go' diagnostic information can be obtained by setting...
* `MUSICRAFT_DBG = 1

... before starting musicraft. Inevitably, perhaps, the choice of what
debug info to output is governed by my issues encountered recently, not by
your issues encountered today, so this is not guaranteed to be helpful!  

This 'debug' mode causes standard output and standard error to be written
to the shell from which musicraft was started, not to the `System` tab of
the `error/diagnostic` panel. This is because the latter disappears without trace if 
musicraft bombs out owing to an unforseen exceptions. [This behaviour is under review.]
Debug info ouput can also be requested by `-D` or `--debug` on the command
line - or explicitly suppressed by `-ND` or `--no-debug`. These overrule
any setting of `MUSICRAFT_DBG` from the environment.

The 'command line programs' write their output to the approprite tabs
of the panel: `Abc2abc` `Abc2midi` and `Abcm2svg`. The last of these
actually relates to `abcm2ps` and is so named because we always use it 
to produce SVG not PS output.

Musicraft was originally designed to work with `Qt4` via either `PyQt4` or
`PySide`. This software is however now deprecated in favour of `Qt5` via either
`PySide2` or `PyQt5`. Accordingly, Musicraft has
been reworked to support these; This behaviour can be selected by settinging an
environment variable:

* `MUSICRAFT_QT = PySide2`
* `MUSICRAFT_QT = PyQt5`

Not overruling this setting is treated as equivalent to...

* `MUSICRAFT_QT = PyQt5`

__Important note regarding 'Qt' dependencies:__

The dependencies of musicraft are defined assuming PyQt5 will be used. If you want to use PySide2,
you will need to install this separately. This is because I had difficulty installing PySide2; you,
of course, may be more successful!

 #### window layout
 
 Before you start inputting music to Musicraft, it is a good idea
 to tweak the window layout to suit your monitor layout:
 
 * If you have just one screen, first click the full-screen button,
 then if necessary use the mouse to to drag the vertical line which divides the
 text area from the score area so that each is wide enough.
 
 * If you have two displays next to each other, you may want to
 drag the whole musicraft window to straddle the two, so that one shows the abc source code,
 the other the score.
 
 * With two or more displays, you may want to 'undock' one or more of the
 three panels by dragging their top line(s) - identified by the texts
 `Editor`, `styled output` and `error/diagnostic output` to
 an empty area of one of the screens.   

*warning:* if you stretch the `styled output` window too much
you may encounter 'extra' unresponsive scroll-bars. This is a bug which I
am having difficulty fixing!

#### ABCplus music notation

It is unlikely that you have got to this stage without
knowing at least something about ABCplus music notation.
Even so, it's always good to have some resources at hand.
The list below will get you started and lead you to more goodies:

* <http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/>
* <http://moinejf.free.fr/abcm2ps-doc/features.xhtml>
* <https://sourceforge.net/projects/abcplus/files/Abcplus/abcplus_en-2019-12-20.zip>

#### Typing in your tune(s)
Assuming you are familiar with ABCplus notation (if not, see previous section!)
you can now simply type the ABCplus code into the `Editor` panel.
The score panel will change as you type. In doing this, musicraft auto-saves
your abc code into a temporary directory and derives one or more temporary `svg` files from it.
Nnonetheless, you must not forget to save your source code regularly with control-S (or via the file menu). 
By each such explicit save action, musicraft derives not only svg file(s) but also a postcript
file with suffix '.ps'.  The derived '.ps' is then used immediately to produce a PDF.


##### keyboard snippets
For most purposes, abcplus is concise; that's waht I like most about it!
Some annotations, can however, be a bit long to type in. This is where keyboared 
snippets come in. When, while typing in a tune, you press the TAB key,
musicraft will look at the previous 'word'. If this word is a known key in the dictionary of snippets,
the coreesponding value will be substitued for the word, e.g. 'MR'<TAB>
ecomes '"_molto rit."'. See `AbcHighlighter.snippets` in
```musicraft/abcraft/syntax.py`.
. If, however, the word is not a key of `snippets`, it will simply
be encloses in exclamation warks. E.g. 'ff'<TAB> becomes '!ff!' - less of a saving but still worth it.
The snippet facility is also intended to support two-part snippets, 
e.g. 'cr'<TAB> for '!<(!' and a subsequent '!<)!' 
but this is not fully implemented.
