# Getting started
Make sure a recent version of Python is installed on your system. Open this directory in a command prompt, then:

1. Install the software:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the development server:
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
Go to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser, or http://localhost:8000/admin/ to log in and get to work!
