## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-20

### Added
- **Comprehensive Component Removal**: Full component removal functionality with lib_symbols cleanup
  - `ComponentCollection.remove()` method for removing components by reference

- **Reference-Based Validation**: Advanced removal testing against KiCAD reference files
  - `test_single_resistor_to_blank()` - validates resistor removal matches blank schematic exactly
  - `test_two_resistors_remove_one_matches_single()` - validates selective removal preserves remaining components
  - Byte-for-byte format preservation during removal operations

- **Professional Configuration System**: Centralized configuration management eliminating anti-patterns
  - `KiCADConfig` class with structured configuration categories
  - Property positioning, grid settings, sheet settings, and tolerance configuration
  - Configurable via public `ksa.config` API for user customization
  - Eliminates hardcoded test coordinates and magic numbers from production code

- **Enhanced UUID Support**: UUID parameters for exact format matching
  - `add_label()`, `add_sheet()`, and `add_sheet_pin()` now accept optional `uuid` parameter
  - Deterministic UUID management for test reproducibility
  - Support for both auto-generated and user-specified UUIDs

### Fixed
- **Format Preservation**: Achieved byte-for-byte compatibility with KiCAD reference files
  - Custom S-expression formatters for wire `pts` elements  
  - Proper float formatting matching KiCAD precision (0.0000 vs 0.0)
  - Fixed coordinate and color formatting inconsistencies
  - All 29 tests now pass with exact format preservation

- **Anti-Pattern Elimination**: Removed hardcoded values and test-specific production code
  - Moved test coordinate logic to configurable positioning system
