# GOAL

Adjust the content below to make it clean and readable:
Remove repeated strings that do not add value to the text.

Remove any content unrelated to the text itself (e.g., metadata, artifacts, or extraction errors).

Format the output as unstructured but clear text.

Do not add extra text, introductions, conclusions, or commentary—only rewrite the provided content as it is.

Do not interpret, analyze, or alter the meaning, intent, or narrative of the text—just reformat it for clarity and readability.

Do not change the text structure, do not write conclusions about it. Your only job is to make it readable. 

Keep the text in its original language, regardless of what it is.
