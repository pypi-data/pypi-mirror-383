class OcpiSession(BaseModel):
    '''
    OCPI 9.3.1. Session Object

    The Session object describes one charging session. That doesnâ€™t mean it is required that energy has been transferred between EV
    and the Charge Point. It is possible that the EV never took energy from the Charge Point because it was instructed not to take
    energy by the driver. But as the EV was connected to the Charge Point, some form of start tariff, park tariff or reservation cost might
    be relevant.

    NOTE: Although OCPI supports such pricing mechanisms, local laws might not allow this.

    It is recommended to add enough `ChargingPeriods` to a Session so that the eMSP is able to provide feedback to the EV driver
    about the progress of the charging session. The ideal amount of transmitted Charging Periods depends on the charging speed. The
    Charging Periods should be sufficient for useful feedback but they should not generate too much unneeded traffic either. How many
    Charging Periods are transmitted is left to the CPO to decide. The following are just some points to consider:

    - Adding a new Charging Period every minute for an AC charging session can be too much as it will yield 180 Charging
    Periods for an (assumed to be) average 3h session.

    - A new Charging Period every 30 minutes for a DC fast charging session is not enough as it will yield only one Charging
    Period for an (assumed to be) average 30min session.

    It is also recommended to add Charging Periods for all moments that are relevant for the Tariff changes, see CDR object
    description for more information.

    For more information about how step_size impacts the calculation of the cost of charging also see the CDR object description.

    NOTE: Different `authorization_reference` values might happen when for example a ReserveNow had a different
    `authorization_reference` then the value returned by a real-time authorization.
