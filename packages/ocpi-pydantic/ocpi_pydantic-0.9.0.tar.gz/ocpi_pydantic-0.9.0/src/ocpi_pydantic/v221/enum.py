    to be sent directly by the EV-Driver. The UNLOCK_CONNECTOR is intended to be used in the rare situation that the connector

    stuck, for example: fail when there is tension on the charging cable when the Charge Point tries to unlock the connector.
    In such a situation the EV-Driver can call either the CPO or the eMSP to retry the unlocking.**
