# 🔐 Crypto Tools — Secure Hashing & Encryption for Python

A lightweight, beginner-friendly yet secure cryptography toolkit for Python.
It supports password hashing, data hashing, and AES-GCM-based file encryption & decryption — all using modern, industry-standard cryptographic practices.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Password Hashing** — Uses Argon2 (the most secure modern algorithm) <br>
✅ **Data Hashing** — Fast and deterministic SHA-256 hashing <br>
✅ **File Encryption** — AES-GCM authenticated encryption (confidentiality + integrity = security Pro Max) <br>
✅ **File Decryption** — Securely decrypts files encrypted with the same password <br>
✅ **Key Derivation** — PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 500,000 iterations <br>
✅ **Simple API** — Four clean, easy-to-use functions <br>
