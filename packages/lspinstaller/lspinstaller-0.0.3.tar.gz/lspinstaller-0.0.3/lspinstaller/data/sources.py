# Syntax
## Root
```
"package name": { data object }
```

The package name is also used for folders in some cases, so make sure the
package name is plain text!

## Data objects

Data objects can have the following main keys:

* github
* npm
* binary
    * The binary spec describes a binary file. Its exact meaning depends on the
      main provider
    * Must be included when using any of  these providers: "github".

### `github`

The github object contains the following keys:
* `fragment`: must be in the format `user/repo`

In addition, the separate `binary` object must be specified.

### `npm`

The npm object contains the following keys:
* `package`: the package name as it's used on npm

### `binary`

The binary object contains the following keys:
* `pattern`: required when using `github` or another provider that finds
  multiple files. Otherwise optional. Mutually exclusive with `url`
* `url`: required when the object is used with a source that's only used for
  the version. See kotlin-lsp for an example. Mutually exclusive with `pattern`
* `link`: describes which files to symlink to the special bin directory.
  Syntax: `"file name in lsp/bin": "filename relative to download root"`
  Currently only used to chmod executables, may be turned into a list if
  symlinking proves undoable.
* `archive`: the archive type. Required. Accepted values: "zip".
* `is_nested`: whether or not the archive is nested, meaning the main archive
  has an inner folder. Clangd, for example, has this, where extracting the
  clangd archive extracts another clangd-<version> folder. Clangd therefore
  sets this to true. kotlin-lsp, on the other hand, just has its bin directory
  immediately after extraction, so it sets false. Required if `archive` is set

The binary object is special, and will never be executed standalone. It exists
to consume data from other providers to actually do the install.

## Special values

In some strings, there are special values. These are in the format `${key}`,
and the currently recognised values are:

* `os`: One of the literals `windows` or `linux`
* `version`: the version as determined by a provider. Note that for versions
  including the `v` prefix, the `v` is stripped and must be included literally
  in the resulting string.

# TODO: need a better way to manage the logic for some of these variables,
# because they are not universally portable. Just with operating systems,
# upper-case first letter does occur in some projects. Some also abbreviate
# windows. Can probably sneak in more lambdas to mitigate this, but  that
# requires passing the whole data object  to the lambda, which is just a mess.
# Lambdas in python are also fairly shit, so that wouldn't be pretty. Maybe
# there's a light-weight templating language that makes sense to use?
