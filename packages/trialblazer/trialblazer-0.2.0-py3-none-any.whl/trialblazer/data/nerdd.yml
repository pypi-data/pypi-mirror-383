  title: Predicting Toxicity Risks in Late-Stage Drug Development
  description: |
    Trialblazer is a machine learning classifier based on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for the
    prediction of compounds with a potentially increased risk of late-stage toxicity leading to
    failures during clinical studies or market withdrawal due to toxicity reasons. The model is
    trained on a dataset compiled from public sources, comprising  1,603 benign drugs and 238 drug
    candidates that failed or were withdrawn due to toxicity. The model does not require prior
    knowledge of the compound's specific biological target(s), making it particularly useful for
    profiling innovative compounds for which such information is typically unavailable.
