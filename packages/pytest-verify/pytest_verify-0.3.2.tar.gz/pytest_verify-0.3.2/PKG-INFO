              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# pytest-verify

**pytest-verify** is a snapshot testing plugin for **pytest** that helps
ensure your test outputs remain consistent across runs.

It automatically saves and compares snapshots of your test results and
optionally provides a **visual diff viewer** for reviewing differences
directly in your terminal.

---

## Installation

Basic installation:

    pip install pytest-verify

With optional visual diff viewer:

    pip install pytest-verify[diff]

The `[diff]` extra installs an enhanced terminal-based diff viewer for
reviewing snapshot differences interactively.

If you plan to test **pandas**, **numpy**, or **pydantic** objects,
install extras:

    pip install pytest-verify[pandas,numpy,pydantic]

You can also combine everything:

    pip install pytest-verify[all]

---

## Usage

You can decorate any pytest test function that **returns a value** with
`@verify_snapshot`.

- On the **first run**, pytest-verify creates baseline snapshots.
- On **subsequent runs**, it compares the new output with the saved
  expected snapshot and highlights differences.

If outputs differ, you’ll see a colorized diff in the terminal or, if
installed, the visual diff viewer will open automatically.

---

### Basic Example (Text)

``` python
from pytest_verify import verify_snapshot

@verify_snapshot()
def test_greeting():
    return "Hello, pytest-verify!"
```

**First run:**  
- Creates two files inside `__snapshots__/`:
  - `test_greeting.expected.txt`
  - `test_greeting.actual.txt`

**Subsequent runs:**  
- Compares the new output with the existing expected snapshot.
- If they differ, a diff is shown (or the visual diff viewer opens if
  installed).

**Snapshot mismatch with diff viewer**

![screenshot](docs/images/test_text_failed.png)

--- - At some point, 'test_greetings()' started returning "Hello,
pytest-verify, you're cool!".

> 🗨️ Test FAILED, pytest-verify will ask whether to replace the expected
> snapshot with the new one or not.

### Basic Example (Json)

``` python
from pytest_verify import verify_snapshot

@@verify_snapshot()
def test_simple_json_snapshot():
    return {"name": "Mohamed", "age": 28, "country": "Morocco"}
```

**Snapshot mismatch with diff viewer**

![screenshot](docs/images/test_simple_json_failed.png)

---

Ignore specific JSON fields:

``` python
@verify_snapshot(ignore_fields=["duration", "timestamp"])
def test_json_with_ignore_fields():
    return {
        "Job": "get_price",
        "price": "100",
        "duration": "20s",
        "timestamp": "2025-10-09T12:00:00Z"
    }
```

---

Test numeric tolerance on floating-point values:

``` python
@verify_snapshot(abs_tol=1e-4, rel_tol=1e-4)
def test_json_with_tolerances():
    return {"temperature": 21.0001, "humidity": 59.9999}
```

---

Fails if order of list elements changes:

``` python
@verify_snapshot(ignore_order_json=False)
def test_json_order_sensitive():
    return {
        "users": [
            {"id": 1, "job_name": "get_price"},
            {"id": 2, "job_name": "get_delta"}
        ]
    }
```

---

![screenshot](docs/images/test_json_order_failed.png)

---

### XML Example (Order Sensitivity)

``` python
from pytest_verify import verify_snapshot

@verify_snapshot(ignore_order_xml=False)
def test_xml_snapshot_order_sensitive():
    return """
    <users>
        <user id="1">Mohamed</user>
        <user id="2">Adnane</user>
    </users>
    """
```

If you reorder the elements, the test will fail.

**\# should fail example:**

``` xml
<users>
    <user id="2">Adnane</user>
    <user id="1">Mohamed</user>
</users>
```

---

![screenshot](docs/images/test_xml_order_failed.png)

---

it is order-insensitive by default `ignore_order_xml=True`.

Verify that small numeric differences in XML attributes or values are
tolerated within the given abs/rel tolerance.

``` python
@verify_snapshot(abs_tol=1e-3, rel_tol=1e-3)
def test_xml_with_numeric_tolerance():
    return """
    <measurements>
        <temperature value="20.001" unit="C"/>
        <pressure>101.325</pressure>
    </measurements>
    """
```

### Dataclass Example

``` python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from pytest_verify import verify_snapshot

@dataclass
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
    country: str

@verify_snapshot(ignore_fields=["id"])
def test_dataclass_snapshot():
    return User(id=123, name="Ayoub", country="France")
```

The dataclass is automatically serialized to JSON and compared on each
test run.

---

### Pydantic Example (Float Tolerance)

``` python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pytest_verify import verify_snapshot

class Product(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    price: float

@verify_snapshot(ignore_fields=["id"], abs_tol=1e-3)
def test_pydantic_snapshot():
    return Product(id=1, name="Laptop", price=999.999)
```

**Requires:** `pip install pytest-verify[pydantic]`

---

### Pandas DataFrame Example

``` python
import pandas as pd
from pytest_verify import verify_snapshot

@verify_snapshot(ignore_columns=["timestamp"], abs_tol=1e-4)
def test_dataframe_snapshot():
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        "timestamp": ["2025-10-09T12:00:00Z", "2025-10-09T12:05:00Z"],
        "city": ["Paris", "Lyon"],
        "temperature": [20.001, 19.999],
        "humidity": [55, 60],
    })
    return df
```

This test compares DataFrames with numerical tolerance and ignored
columns.

**Requires:** `pip install pytest-verify[pandas]`

---

### NumPy Array Example

``` python
import numpy as np
from pytest_verify import verify_snapshot

@verify_snapshot(abs_tol=1e-4, rel_tol=1e-4)
def test_numpy_snapshot():
    return np.array([[1.0001, 2.0001], [3.0002, 4.0003]])
```

**Requires:** `pip install pytest-verify[numpy]`

---

## Behavior Summary

| Step | Description |
|----|----|
| First run | Creates both <span class="title-ref">.expected</span> and <span class="title-ref">.actual</span> snapshots (identical) |
| Later runs | Compares new output with existing <span class="title-ref">.expected</span> |
| Match | ✅ Confirms match and updates snapshot |
| Mismatch | ⚠️ Shows diff or opens visual viewer |
| Accept changes | 📝 Updates <span class="title-ref">.expected</span> and saves a <span class="title-ref">.bak</span> backup |

---

## Visual Diff Viewer

If installed via `[diff]`, pytest-verify automatically uses a visual
diff viewer:

- Opens automatically when snapshots differ.
- Allows reviewing and accepting/rejecting changes interactively.
- Works entirely within the terminal — no external tools required.

**Requires:** `pip install pytest-verify[diff]`

---

## Developer Notes

Local installation for development:

    pip install -e '.[all]'

Run tests:

    pytest -s

Clean old snapshots:

    find . -name "*.actual.*" -delete
