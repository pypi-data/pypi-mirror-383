Github workflow cheat sheet

1. Tests


Add test dependencies
uv add flake8 pytest coverage pycodestyle autopep8

Use latest (2.3.1) for autopep8, otherwise it errors out because it needs outdated packages like  lib2to3 (remove then uv pip install autopep==2.3.1). Reason is probably that python version is set to include 3.8 which has the older autopep8 version.


Exclude files from testing:
package_root/.coveragerc
[run]
omit = *_version.py


Add .github/workflow/tests.yml file with on push trigger



2. Badge
Readme.md:
![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://github.com/k4144/pypi_packaging_turorial/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)



3. linting
Use on folder src, tests
For folder tests:
uv run flake8 tests # shows format errors
uv run autopep8 -i -a -a -r tests # fixes format errors

if errors remain, fix manually or ignore by adding error number, e.g:
project_root/setup.cfg
[flake8]
ignore=F401,F811
