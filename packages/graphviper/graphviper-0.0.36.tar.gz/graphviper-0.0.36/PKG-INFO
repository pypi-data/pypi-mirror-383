GraphVIPER (Visibility and Image Parallel Execution Reduction) is a [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/) based MapReduce package. It allows for mapping a dictionary of [xarray.Dataset](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html)s to [Dask graph nodes](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/graphs.html) followed by a reduce step.

**GraphVIPER is in development and breaking API changes will happen.**

The best place to start with GraphVIPER is doing the [graph building tutorial](https://graphviper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/graph_building_tutorial.html).
