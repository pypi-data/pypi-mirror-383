## 🚀 Getting Started

This guide provides instructions for installing and running `pipeline-eds`. To ensure you follow the right path, first choose the method that best fits your needs.

---
## ⚡Quick Start

For detailed installation and usage instructions, see [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md).  
This guide includes step-by-step commands for Windows, Linux, Termux, and developer setups.

### Choosing Your Installation Method

  * **For the absolute simplest setup (No Python required):** If you want to run the tool without installing Python or managing dependencies, use a pre-built binary. Follow **Method 1: Using Pre-Built Binaries**.
  * **For an easy CLI setup with simple updates:** If you are comfortable with the command line and want to easily keep the tool updated, `pipx` is the recommended approach. Follow **Method 2: CLI Installation with `pipx`**.
  * **For developing and contributing to the project:** If you plan to modify the source code, you need a full development environment. Follow **Method 3: Developer Setup with Poetry**.
  * **For installing from a Git clone without Poetry (Advanced):** If you have cloned the repository and need to install dependencies manually with `pip`, follow **Method 4: Installing from a Git Clone with `pip`**.

-----

### Method 1: Using Pre-Built Binaries (`.exe`, `.elf`, `.pyz`)

This is the easiest way to get started, especially on systems where you don't have Python installed. These are standalone packages that you can download and run directly.

1.  **Download the appropriate binary** for your system from the project's [**GitHub Releases page**](https://github.com/City-of-Memphis-Wastewater/pipeline/releases).

    - `pipeline-eds*.exe`: For Windows.
    - `pipeline-eds* (ELF has no extension)`: For Linux and Termux on Android.
    - `pipeline-eds*.pyz`: A zipapp for any system that has Python installed.

2.  **Place the file** in a convenient location.
	```bash
	# On Termux (Android)
	termux-setup-storage
	cp storage/downloads/ . to copy the file from your Android downloads folder to your $HOME folder
	```
	On iSH, you launch by default in the `root` directory, and the executible can be copied here (if you would like) manually using the file browser.

3.  **Run the command** from your terminal. You may need to make the `.elf` file executable first (`chmod +x pipeline-eds-*`).

    ```bash
    # On Windows
    .\pipeline-eds-*.exe config

    # On Linux or Termux
    ./pipeline-eds-* config
    ```

For more details on the pros and cons of each binary type, see the **Distribution and Packaging** section below.

-----

### Method 2: CLI Installation with `pipx` (Recommended for CLI Users)

`pipx` installs and runs Python applications in isolated environments. This is the best way to get easy updates and avoid conflicts with other Python packages.

**1. Install Python and `pip`**

If you don't have them, install them using your system's package manager or an official installer.
> **Windows Note:** If installing from the `.exe` installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), be sure to check the box for **"Add Python to PATH"** during setup.

```bash
# On Windows (using a package manager in PowerShell)
winget install Python.Python.3.11
# Or with Chocolatey:
# choco install python

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python-is-python3

# On Termux (Android)
pkg update && pkg install python
pkg install python python-cryptography python-numpy 

# Some of these are likely overkill given prepackaged cryptography, but I want you to succeed, and I will continue testing.
plg install clang make libffi openssl-dev libffi-dev
# pkg install rust # probably not necessary, with `python-cryptography` installed

# On Alpine (iSH on iOS)
apk update && apk add python3 py3-pip
apk add py3-cryptography py3-numpy

# Some of these are likely overkill given prepackaged cryptography, but I want you to succeed, and I will continue testing.
apk add openssl-dev libffi-dev
```

**2. Install `pipx`**

Use `pip` to install `pipx` and add its scripts to your system's PATH.

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

*(You may need to restart your terminal for the PATH change to take effect.)*

**3. Install `pipeline-eds`**

Install the package from PyPI using `pipx`.

```bash
# For all systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)
pipx install pipeline-eds

# For Termux and iSH, which require dedicated system site packages like py3-cryptography
pipx install --system-site-packages pipeline-eds

# For Windows users who want database features from the pyodbc library (the usefulness of this has not yet been developed).
pipx install "pipeline-eds[windows]"

# If you want non-browser plotting with Matplotlib (Linux, macOS, Windows)
pipx install "pipeline-eds[mpl]"
# With the `trend` command, use the `--webplot` flag to direct the plot to plotly HTML anyways and circumvent Matplotlib.
```

**4. Run Commands**

You can now use the `eds` alias directly in your terminal. There is also the `pipeline` alias and the `pipeline-eds` alias.

```bash
eds config
eds trend M100FI --start June3 --end June17
```

-----

### Method 3: Developer Setup with Poetry

This method is for contributors who need a full development environment to modify the source code.
Learn more about [git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrD3z9_9DXU).

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/City-of-Memphis-Wastewater/pipeline.git
cd pipeline
```

**2. Install `pyenv` and `Poetry`**

This project uses `pyenv` to manage Python versions and `Poetry` for dependency management.
You do not need `pyenv`.
This project is is compatible with Python 3.8 to 3.14, so there's not a huge demand for your to dial in a specific version.

  * **`pyenv`:** Follow the official installation guide for your OS ([pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for Linux/macOS, [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) for Windows).
  * **`Poetry`:** Follow the official [Poetry installation guide](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://python-poetry.org/docs/%23installation).

**3. Configure the Project Environment**

If you so choose.

```bash
pyenv install 3.11.9
pyenv local 3.11.9
poetry env use 3.11.9
```

**4. Install Dependencies**

Yes, this part is entirely necessary.

```bash
poetry install
```

**5. Run Commands**

Execute all commands with `poetry run`. The `[tool.poetry.scripts]` section in `pyproject.toml` allows `eds` to work as an alias for `python -m pipeline.cli`.

```bash
poetry run eds config
poetry run eds ping
```

-----

### Method 4: Installing from a Git Clone with `pip` (Advanced)

This method is for users who have cloned the repository but prefer to manage the environment with `pip` and `venv`. This is often necessary on platforms like **Termux** or **iSH (Alpine)**.
A use-case for this is for generating binaries on a system such that it is compatible with that system (Note that **iSH** emulates x86_64).

**1. Clone the Repository**

If you haven't already, clone the project from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/City-of-Memphis-Wastewater/pipeline.git
cd pipeline
```

**2. Export Dependencies to `requirements.txt`**

This project's dependencies are in `pyproject.toml` and I have tried to export as necessary to the `requirements.txt` file. 
The `requirements.txt` is availible in the root of the package.
But, if you need to update the `requirements.txt` file, you can though on another system because `poetry` is unavailable on Termux.

```bash
# Install poetry if you don't have it
pip install poetry
# Export the requirements file
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes
# You can now uninstall poetry if you wish
# pip uninstall poetry
```

**3. Install System Dependencies and Create a Virtual Environment**

The steps below are platform-specific.

#### For Termux (Android)

1.  **Install System Build Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
	pkg install python python-cryptography python-numpy rust clang make openssl-dev libffi-dev
    
	# The build tools (rust, clang, etc.) are generally not needed IF the 
    # Termux-installed packages satisfy the requirements.
    # The below line can likely be removed if --system-site-packages is used, 
    # but we will leave it for max compatibility.
    pkg install rust clang make openssl-dev libffi-dev
    ```
2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
	# CRITICAL: Use the --system-site-packages flag to access Termux's pre-compiled packages.
    python -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run Commands:**
    ```bash
    python -m pipeline.cli config
    ```

#### For iSH / Alpine Linux (iOS)

1.  **Install System Build Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    apk update
	
	# Install the core Python environment tools and essential pre-compiled Python libraries
    # Installing 'py3-cryptography' and 'py3-numpy' via apk avoids difficult, lengthy compilation from source later.
    apk add python3 py3-pip py3-cryptography py3-numpy
    
	# Some of these are likely overkill given prepackaged cryptography, but I want you to succeed, and I will continue testing.
    apk add gcc musl-dev build-base openssl-dev libffi-dev 
    
	```
2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
	# The '--system-site-packages' flag is crucial: it allows this venv to access the
    # pre-compiled Python packages (like py3-cryptography) installed in the previous step 
    # by the system package manager (apk). This satisfies their requirements without re-installing.
	python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
    
	# Activate the virtual environment
	source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
	# Install all project-specific dependencies defined in the requirements file.
    # 'pip' will install these packages into the isolated '.venv', while still
    # using the system packages (if needed) due to the venv's configuration.
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run Commands:**
    ```bash
	 # Execute the main application command using the Python interpreter from the activated venv.
    python3 -m pipeline.cli trend M100FI
	
	# Deactivate the virtual environment. This resets the shell's PATH to the system's 
    # default Python environment.
    deactivate
    
    # NOTE: If you run the software after deactivating, the 'python3' command will only see
    # system-installed libraries, not the packages installed specifically for this project.
    # You can reactivate the environment anytime using 'source .venv/bin/activate' if you are 
    # in the project's directory.
    ```

### ⚠️ Notes and Limitations
- These packages simplify **installation** on disconnected systems, but the application itself requires internet access to function (API calls).
- **Alpine / iSH (iPhone)**: Pre-built MUSL-compatible executables (.elf) are not yet available but are expected soon. However, a source installation using pip and the specific steps in Method 4 is possible on iSH.
- **Docker orchestration**: Currently builds are processed manually. Future goals include automated orchestration and registry publishing.

---

## 🛠️ Build Scripts

If you want to build a binary from source, it is recommended to do it on the system you are targetting, specifically in regards to the architecture (ARM vs x86_64).
Example: Recall that iSH emulates x86_64, so an ELF built on a x86_64 architecture laptop using Alpine in WSL2 should succeed on running in iSH.

### `build_executable.py`
- Automates creation of `.exe` and `.elf` binaries.
- Targets:
  - Windows standalone `.exe`
  - Linux `.elf` (both WSL2 Ubuntu and Termux builds)
- Intended for distributing binaries to systems without requiring Python ins>
- Currently run manually; future goal is to integrate into an automated buil>

### `build_shiv.sh`
- Automates creation of `.pyz` zipapps and corresponding `.bat` launchers.
- Targets:
  - Cross‑platform `.pyz` archives
  - Windows `.bat` wrapper for smooth launching
- Provides a maintainable, portable distribution option for Python‑ready sys>
- Currently run manually; orchestration and CI/CD integration are planned.

## ✨ Tips for Optimal Usage & Maintenance
To ensure a smooth and efficient experience with `pipeline-eds`, consider the following best practices:

### Keep `pipeline-eds` Updated: 
Regularly upgrade your `pipeline-eds` installation to benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.
```bash
pipx upgrade pipeline-eds
```
This command will update pipeline-eds and its dependencies in its isolated pipx environment.

### Maintain Your Python Environment:

- Desktop Users: While `pipx` isolates `pipeline-eds`, it's good practice to keep your underlying Python installation updated.
- Termux Users: Regularly update your Termux environment and packages to ensure compatibility and security:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

### Understanding eds config and Credential Management:
The first time you execute a command requiring access to your EDS API (e.g., eds trend), `pipeline-eds` will guide you through a one-time configuration process. Your sensitive API credentials (URL, username, password) are securely stored using your operating system's native keyring service. This is a robust and secure method that avoids storing plaintext passwords in files. If your credentials change, you can re-run eds config at any time to update them.

### Network Connectivity (VPN Essential):
A critical requirement for `pipeline-eds` to function is proper network connectivity to your Emerson Ovation EDS machine. If your EDS server is located on a private network (e.g., within your organization's internal network), you must be connected to the appropriate Virtual Private Network (VPN). Failure to do so will result in connection errors when `pipeline-eds` attempts to fetch data.

### Leveraging Flexible Date/Time Inputs:
The `eds trend` command offers highly flexible date and time parsing for its --start and --end options, thanks to the `pendulum` package. You can use a wide variety of natural language inputs, such as:

- `--start "2023-09-18"`
- `--start "Sept 18"`
- `--end "now"` 

Experiment with different formats to suit your query needs. Remember to use quotes around values if they contain spaces.
It would be great if terms like "yesterday" worked, but these fail to be recognized by `pendulum`.

<br>

## 🔐 Security & Configuration

`pipeline` uses a two-tiered approach to manage configuration and secrets.

  * **Non-Sensitive Configuration**: Non-sensitive settings like URLs and paths are stored in a local JSON file (`~/.pipeline-eds/config.json`). This file is easy to inspect and manage.
  * **Secrets and Credentials**: For CLI users, API credentials and passwords are **securely stored** using your operating system's native keyring. This is a much safer alternative to storing plaintext passwords in a file. The `pipeline config` command guides you through this one-time setup process.

**Note for Developers**: While the CLI now uses the keyring, some functionality within the codebase still relies on the `secrets.yaml` file for credential management. This file is not required for general CLI usage but may be necessary for specific development workflows and legacy components.

**Important**: You must be on the same network as your server (e.g., via a VPN) if it is not publicly accessible.

<br>

## ⚙️ Project Implementation & Use Cases

`pipeline` is designed to be deployed as a scheduled task on a Windows server.

  * The project is executed by **Windows Task Scheduler**, which calls a PowerShell script (`main_eds_to_rjn_quiet.ps1`) as the entry point.
  * The iterative timing (e.g., hourly execution) is handled by the `Task Scheduler`, not by Python.
  * For these automated tasks, a standard `venv` is used, as `Task Scheduler` can run under different user accounts.

## 📱 Running on Android (`Termux`)

The `pipeline` project can be installed and run on Android devices using the **[Termux](https://termux.dev/)** terminal emulator.  
For most users, **CLI installation via `pipx` is the recommended method**, as development is not expected in this environment and `pipx` provides the smoothest way to stay up to date.

### Termux Installation Options

There are several ways to run `pipeline` inside Termux, depending on your needs:

- **`pipx` (Recommended)**  
  - Provides rolling updates and integrates with the Termux home‑screen widget.  
  - As of **v0.3.8**, you `eds install` will generate a **shortcut button** in the Termux widget to update `pipeline-eds` without needing to open the terminal.  
  - Requires Python and `pipx` to be installed.  
  - Best choice if you want to keep up with frequent changes.

- **Native ELF Binary**  
  - A prebuilt `.elf` binary is available specifically for Termux.  
  - Runs without requiring Python to be installed.  
  - Avoids the `.shortcuts` widget permission error that can occur when launching `.pyz` apps.  
  - Smoothest rollout for users who just want the CLI tool without expecting updates.

- **`.pyz` Zipapp**  
  - ⚠️ Known limitation: launching `.pyz` directly from the Termux `.shortcuts` widget may trigger a **permission error**.

---

### ✅ Recommendations

- Use **`pipx`** if you want the latest updates and widget integration.  
- Use the **native ELF binary** if you want the simplest, no‑Python setup.  
- Use **`.pyz`** only if you already have Python installed and are comfortable updating the archive manually.



### 🌐 Termux and Web-Based Visuals (Plotly)
When using `pipeline-eds` in Termux to generate plots (e.g., with `eds trend`), the visuals are displayed as web-based HTML pages using libraries like Plotly. Instead of directly opening a graphical window (which is not typically supported by Termux's command-line environment), `pipeline-eds` serves these HTML files via a local web server (often on localhost).

### Why localhost

- Termux Sandboxing: Termux operates in a sandboxed environment on Android. This security measure restricts direct access to certain system resources, including the ability to automatically launch web browsers or other GUI applications from the command line.
- Local Server Approach: To work around this, `pipeline-eds` acts as a small web server, making the generated HTML plot accessible at a specific localhost URL (e.g., [http://127.0.0.1:8000.](http://127.0.0.1:8000`.)
- Manual Opening: Improvemenrs have been made using `xdg-open` and `termux-url-open`, so manual opening of web graphics is no longer required. Due to the sandboxing, Termux has limited ways to automatically open this URL in your default Android browser, but it is possible and now suceeds. Another approach is the `am` command, or `termux-api` but those are not used in this package. If for any reason auyomatic launching fails, you canmanually copy the provided URL from the Termux output and paste it into your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) on your Android device. This allows your full-featured browser to render the interactive Plotly graph.
- Security: Localhost-based plotting is also a security measure, ensuring that applications within Termux explicitly serve content, and the user is able to view it in a secure yet less restricted environment (the browser).  Using localhost allows for a minimal Termux installation, like from the Pay Store, without relying on `termux-gui` or `x11`.

### Important Notes on Conditional Dependencies

To maintain compatibility across this range, **Poetry** automatically pins several major dependencies based on your Python version, ensuring maximum stability.

- **Python 3.9+ (Recommended)**: Installations on Python 3.9 and newer automatically receive the latest, feature-rich major versions of core libraries such as `keyring`, `pendulum`, `urllib3`, and the development tools `pytest` and `pytest-cov`.
    
- **Python 3.8 (Legacy)**: If you install on Python 3.8, you will receive older, but still compatible and secure, versions of the following packages:
    
    - `keyring` (`^24.3`)
    - `pendulum` (`^2.1.2`)
    - `urllib3` (`^1.26.19`)
    - `uvicorn` (`^0.33.0`)
    - `mysql-connector-python` (`^8.3.0`)
        
### Recommended Version

**Python 3.11 or newer is highly recommended** for the best performance, security, and access to the latest features from all third-party libraries. If you are using the Developer Setup, please target Python 3.11.9 as specified in the getting started guide.

## Comparison: `pipeline-eds` Python Package vs Emerson Ovation EDS Excel Add-In vs EDS Portal Webapp

### **1. Emerson Ovation EDS Excel Add-In**

**Pros:**

* Integrates directly into Excel, a familiar environment for many users.
* Supports creating tabular trends and exporting EDS data within spreadsheets.
* Good for ad-hoc data analysis if you are comfortable with Excel.
* **Insert Tabular Trend** functionality is diversified from the **EDS Excel Function library** (`EDS point fields`, `EDS archives`, `EDS steam tables`, `EDS tabular trends`)

**Cons:**

* The interface for generating data (e.g., via **Insert tabular trend**) is **cumbersome and not very intuitive**.
* Users must manually insert charts after data extraction unless they have a pre-built spreadsheet template.
* Requires Excel to be installed.
* Requires **admin rights to install an MSI package** provided by Emerson, which can be a barrier in locked-down environments.
* Not scriptable or easily automated unless the user is comortbale calling XLSX files from Task Scheduler.
* Limited performance for rapid exploration or querying.


### **2. Emerson EDS Portal Webapp**

**Pros:**

* Web-based, no local installation required.
* Intuitive UI for browsing EDS data.
* Good for **interactive, point-and-click exploration**.
* Tab-building allows for excellent stable page-based system analysis, so the inqueries do not need to be repeated.

**Cons:**

* To visualize **one-off sensor curves**, you must:

  * Open the filter utility.
  * Manually type in the full IESS (sensor ID).
  * Adjust time ranges via multiple clicks.
* Limited ability to automate or integrate data retrieval into other workflows.
* Data export is usually manual.
* Requires a web browser and network access.


### **3. `pipeline-eds` Python Package**

**Pros:**

* **CLI-based**, enabling extremely **fast visualization of one-off sensor curves** with simple commands.
* No GUI overhead: you just run a command like `pipeline trend ABC XYZ --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-01-31` and get results quickly.
* Supports automation and scripting for repetitive or scheduled data extraction and processing.
* Minimal installation requirements: only needs a shell environment (PowerShell, Bash).
* Works on platforms where Excel or full web browsers may not be available.
* Can be used on **mobile devices** through tools like Termux on Android, avoiding the need for Emerson’s paid mobile app license.
* Open-source, so you can extend or customize the tool.
* Integrates easily with Python-based data workflows, dashboards, or analytics tools.

**Cons:**

* Requires familiarity with command-line interfaces and scripting (though the Termux shortcuts widget allows mobile users to not use the terminal directly.)
* No graphical input UI (yet) for those who prefer point-and-click.
* May require initial setup and learning curve if you are not familiar with Python or CLI tools.

### **4. Mobile Use Case**

* **Emerson Mobile Apps** (iOS and Android) require additional licensing and purchase from Emerson.
* `pipeline-eds` can be run on mobile devices using:

  * **Termux** (Android) or similar terminal emulators.
  * Any SSH client connected to a remote system with the package installed.
* This approach **undercuts the need for Emerson’s mobile app license**, providing a lightweight, free way to query and visualize EDS data on the go.
* Great for field engineers or operators needing quick access to sensor data without carrying a laptop or paying for extra licenses.

### Software Comparison Final Thoughts

If you mainly need **quick, interactive visualizations occasionally**, and prefer GUIs, the `Excel Add-In` or `Portal` may suffice.

If you want **fast, automated, scriptable access**, with the flexibility to integrate into broader workflows — especially **for repeated sensor curve visualizations** — `pipeline-eds` is much more efficient.

If **mobile access without extra license costs** is important, `pipeline-eds` on Termux or similar CLI apps is a strong advantage.

## 📝 Final Note on Naming
The project is internally referred to as `pipeline`, but the PyPI package is named `pipeline-eds` to avoid a name conflict with an existing, unrelated package on PyPI. For CLI usage, the pyproject.toml file creates aliases so you can use `pipeline`, `eds`, and `pipeline-eds` interchangeably in your terminal. This allows for a more intuitive command-line experience without the need to use the full PyPI package name.
