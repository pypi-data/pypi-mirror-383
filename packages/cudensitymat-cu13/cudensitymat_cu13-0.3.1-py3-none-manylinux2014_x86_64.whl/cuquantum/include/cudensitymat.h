 * \brief External scalar gradient CPU/GPU callback function returning
 * gradients with respect to the passed user-provided real parameter values.
 *
 * \details This callback function signature supports differentiation
 * in both directions:
 *  - Forward differentiation (not supported yet):
 *      The callback function takes a seed of the parameters gradient
 *      and returns the gradient of the (potentially batched) scalar
 *      coefficient with respect to the chosen parameters gradient seed.
 *  - Backward differentiation:
 *      The callback function takes the adjoint of the (potentailly batched)
 *      scalar coefficient and returns the contribution to the gradient of
 *      the total cost function with respect to the user-provided real parameter
 *      values that originates from that scalar coefficient.
 *
 * \note In case of backward differentiation, argument `scalarGrad[batchSize]`,
 * which is the adjoint of the (potentially batched) complex scalar coefficient
 * parameterizing a user-defined operator, is in general a complex vector of
 * size `batchSize`. Since we always assume a real total cost function which
 * we want to differentiate with respect to the user-provided real parameter values,
 * the scalar gradient callback function is supposed to implement the following:
 *   1. Compute the vector-Jacobian product (VJP) of the passed adjoint of the
 *      (potentially batched) scalar coefficient with the Jacobian of that
 *      (potentially batched) scalar coeffient with respect to all user-provided
 *      real parameter values, which will produce a generally complex tensor
 *      of shape `[numParams, batchSize]`, specifically:
 *        `Gradient[i,j] = AdjointCoefficient[j] * dAdjointCoefficient[j]/dParams[i,j]`,
 *        for all `i` in `[0, numParams-1]` and `j` in `[0, batchSize-1]`.
 *   2. Take the real part of the resulting complex tensor, multiply it by 2,
 *      and accumulate it into the `paramsGrad[numParams, batchSize]` array.
 *      Thus, `paramsGrad` must be initialized to zero externally by the user
 *      before the backward differentiation is started. During the backward
 *      differentiation pass, `paramsGrad` will accumulate all partial derivatives
 *      of all explicitly differentiated quantities with respect to the user-provided
 *      real parameter values (for all instances of the batch).
 *
 * \param[in] time Time value.
 * \param[in] batchSize User-defined batch size (>=1).
 * \param[in] numParams Number of external real parameters the full operator depends on.
 * \param[in] params GPU-accessible pointer to an F-ordered 2d-array
 * of user-defined real parameter values: `params[numParams, batchSize]`.
 * \param[in] dataType Data type of the passed (potentially batched) scalar.

/**
 * \brief External tensor gradient CPU/GPU callback function returning
 * gradients with respect to the passed user-provided real parameter values.
 *
 * \details This callback function signature supports differentiation
 * in both directions:
 *  - Forward differentiation (not supported yet):
 *      The callback function takes a seed of the parameters gradient
 *      and returns the gradient of the (potentially batched) tensor
 *      with respect to the chosen parameters gradient seed.
 *  - Backward differentiation:
 *      The callback function takes the adjoint of the (potentailly batched)
 *      tensor and returns the contribution to the gradient of the total cost function
 *      with respect to the user-provided real parameter values that originates from
 *      that tensor.
 *
 * \note In case of backward differentiation, argument `tensorGrad[{tensorShape}, batchSize]`
 * is the adjoint of the (potentially batched) elementary operator tensor inside a user-defined
 * operator. Since we always assume a real total cost function which we want to differentiate
 * with respect to the user-provided real parameter values, the tensor gradient callback function
 * is supposed to implement the following:
 *   1. Compute the vector-Jacobian product (VJP) of the passed adjoint of the
 *      (potentially batched) elementary operator tensor with the Jacobian of that
 *      (potentially batched) elementary operator tensor with respect to all user-provided
 *      real parameter values, which will produce a generally complex tensor
 *      of shape `[numParams, batchSize]`, specifically:
 *        `Gradient[i,j] = Sum_{shape} AdjointTensor[{shape},j] * dAdjointTensor[{shape},j]/dParams[i,j]`,
 *        for all `i` in `[0, numParams-1]` and `j` in `[0, batchSize-1]`,
 *        where `{shape}` includes all tensor indices (except the batch index)
 *        that we are summing over in the summation.
 *   2. Take the real part of the resulting complex tensor, multiply it by 2,
 *      and accumulate it into the `paramsGrad[numParams, batchSize]` array.
 *      Thus, `paramsGrad` must be initialized to zero externally by the user
 *      before the backward differentiation is started. During the backward
 *      differentiation pass, `paramsGrad` will accumulate all partial derivatives
 *      of all explicitly differentiated quantities with respect to the user-provided
 *      real parameter values (for all instances of the batch).
 *
 * \param[in] sparsity Elementary tensor operator sparsity kind.
 * \param[in] numModes Number of modes in the returned tensor (without the batch mode).
 * Only even-rank tensors are supported, where the first half of the modes
 * are the ket modes, and the second half are the bra modes.
 * \param[in] modeExtents Mode extents of the returned tensor (without the batch mode).
 * \param[in] diagonalOffsets For CUDENSITYMAT_OPERATOR_SPARSITY_MULTIDIAGONAL,
 * offsets of the stored non-zero diagonals of the elementary tensor operator
 * matrix: The main diagonal has offset zero, the below-main diagonals have
 * negative offsets, the above-main diagonals have positive offsets.
 * For CUDENSITYMAT_OPERATOR_SPARSITY_NONE, this argument has no meaning
 * and can be set to NULL.
 * \param[in] time Time value.
 * \param[in] batchSize User-defined batch size (>=1).
 * \param[in] numParams Number of external real parameters the full operator depends on.
 * \param[in] params GPU-accessible pointer to an F-ordered 2d-array
 * of user-defined real parameter values: `params[numParams, batchSize]`.
 * \param[in] dataType Data type of the passed (potentially batched) tensor.

 * tensor adjoint (IN) or tensor gradient (OUT) array of length `batchSize` times

 * corresponding bra modes of matching extents, where both sets have the same
 * number of modes and the ket modes precede the bra modes, both in the same order.
 * For example, T[i0, i1, j0, j1] is a 2-body tensor operator in which modes {i0, i1}
 * form a set of the ket modes while modes {j0, j1} form the corresponding set of
 * the bra modes, where the ket mode i0 corresponds to the bra mode j0, and the ket mode
 * i1 corresponds to the bra mode j1 (the modes are always paired this way). Only one mode
 * in each pair of the corresponding modes is contracted with the quantum state tensor,
 * either from the left or from the right. For example, either the bra mode j0 is
 * contracted with a specific ket mode of the quantum state, representing an operator
 * action from the left, or the ket mode i0 is contracted with a specific bra mode
 * of the quantum state, representing an operator action from the right. Then,
 * the corresponding remaining uncontracted mode replaces the contracted mode
 * of the quantum state.

 *
 * \note Currently the multi-diagonal storage format is only supported

/**
 * \brief Computes backward differentiation of the operator action on a given quantum state.
 *
 * \details In general, an operator can be parameterized by a set of user-defined real parameters
 * which parameterize elementary tensor operators, matrix operators, and coefficients
 * which are used to define the operator. This function computes the partial derivatives
 * of the operator action on a quantum state with respect to the user-defined real parameters.
 * Specifically, the function computes the Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) of the operator action
 * on the quantum state with respect to the user-defined real parameters. That is, given the adjoint
 * of the output quantum state, the function computes the following quantities:
 *   - partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to the user-defined real parameters
 *     which parameterize the operator (explicit derivatives).
 *   - adjoint of the input quantum state (implicit derivatives).
 * Symbolically, this can be expressed as follows:
 *
 *   Operator action:
 *     y[i] += A(p)[i,j] * x[j]
 *   where A(p) is the operator parameterized by N user-defined real parameters p[n], 1 <= n <= N,
 *   y is the output quantum state, and x is the input quantum state.
 *
 *   Forward derivatives:
 *     dy[i] = A[i,j] * dx[j] + dA[i,k] * x[k]
 *
 *   Backward derivatives (these two are computed by the current API function):
 *     Input quantum state adjoint: dc/dx[j] = dc/dy[i] * A[i,j]
 *     Partial operator derivatives: dc/dp[n] = dc/dy[i] * (dA[i,k] * x[k])/dp[n]
 *
 *     Given the above two quantities, the full operator action derivatives can be constructed as:
 *     Full operator action derivatives: dc/dp[n] = dc/dx[j] * dx[j]/dp[n] +
 *                                                  (dc/dy[i] * (dA[i,k] * x[k])/dp[n])
 *
 * When computing the partial operator derivatives, the term (dA[i,k] * x[k])/dp[n]
 * is computed as a sum of contributions over all differentiable elementary tensor
 * operators, matrix operators, and complex scalar coefficients which parameterize
 * the operator, as follows:
 *   dc/dp[n] = (dA[i,k] * x[k])/dp[n] = sum_j (dA[i,k] * x[k])/qQ[j] * dQ[j]/dp[n]
 * where Q[j] is a specific differentiable quantity (elementary tensor operator, matrix operator,
 * or complex scalar coefficient) which parameterizes the operator, and dQ[j]/dp[n]
 * is the partial derivative of Q[j] with respect to the n-th user-defined real parameter p[n].
 * Each dQ[j]/dp[n] is specified by a user-provided scalar/tensor gradient callback function
 * which takes the adjoint of the corresponding quantity Q[j] as an input argument (`scalarGrad`
 * or `tensorGrad`), multiplies it by the dQ[j]/dp[n] Jacobian, and accumulates the REAL part
 * of the result multipled by TWO (since the total cost function is always real) in the output array
 * of partial derivatives with respect to the user-defined real parameters (argument `paramsGrad`).
 * If the state/operator is batched, the partial derivatives are computed for the entire batch,
 * in which case the `paramsGrad` array must have shape [numParams, batchSize] in the F-order,
 * while the `scalarGrad` and `tensorGrad` arrays can be either batched or non-batched, based
 * on the corresponding quantity Q[j] being batched or non-batched. In case the quantity Q[j]
 * is not batched while the quantum states are batched, the `scalarGrad` and `tensorGrad` arrays
 * passed to the gradient callback function will not be batched, but the `params` and `paramsGrad`
 * arrays will be batched, but only their first batch instance will actually be used (argument
 * batchSize will be set to 1 in this case), specifically, only `params[0:N-1, 0]` and
 * `paramsGrad[0:N-1, 0]` will be used.
