    1.0.0
    #####

    Release expected 2026-H1.

0.2.0
#####

Release expected 2025-10-10.

New Features
-----------

* Compute lattice B matrix.
* '@crw_decorator()':  Decorator for the ConfigurationRunWrapper

Fixes
-----------

* Allow update of '.core.extras["h2"] = 1.0'
* Energy was not changed initially by 'wavelength.put(new_value)'.
* DiffractometerError raised by 'hklpy2.user.wh()''
* TypeError from 'diffractometer.wh()' and EPICS.
* TypeError when diffractometer was not connected.

Maintenance
-----------

* Add advice files for virtual AI chat agents.
* Add and demonstrate SPEC-style pseudoaxes.
* Add inverse transformation to DiffractometerBase.scan_extra() method.
* Add virtual axes.
* Complete 'refineLattice()' for Core and Sample.
* Compute B from sample lattice.
* Control displayed precision of position tuples using 'DIFFRACTOMETER.digits' property.
* Consistent response when no forward solutions are found.
* Engineering units throughout
    * Solver defines the units it uses.
    * Conversion to/from solver's units.
    * Lattice, beam, rotational axes can all have their own units.
    * Ensure unit cell edge length units match wavelength units.
* Extend 'creator()' factory for custom real axis specifications.
* Improve code coverage.
* New GHA jobs cancel in in-progress jobs.
* Pick the 'forward()' solution closest to the current angles.
* 'scan_extra' plan now supports one or more extras (similar to bp.scan).
* Simple math for reflections: r1+r2, r1-r2, r1 == r2, ...
* Update table with SPEC comparison

0.1.5
#####

Released 2025-07-21.

Fixes
-----------

0.1.4
#####

Released 2025-07-18.

New Features
------------

* Added FAQ document.
* Added 'pick_closest_solution()' as alternative 'forward()' decision function.
