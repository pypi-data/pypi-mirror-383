# Shufflish

Shufflish is the answer whenever you need to _kind of_ shuffle ranges of many
integers.
Think Billions, Trillions, ... of integers, where you have to question
whether they all fit into memory.

The key advantages of shufflish are virtually no setup time, a permutation
occupies just 80 bytes, and yet it can be randomly accessed like an array.
When shuffling 100M integers, it is 25 times faster than
[random.shuffle()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.shuffle),
three times faster than
[numpy.random.shuffle()](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.shuffle.html#numpy.random.shuffle),
and even ten times faster than
[random.randrange()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randrange),
even though that obviously does not produce a permutation.

With shufflish, you can effortlessly run massively parallel tasks on large
datasets with some degree of randomness by simply sharing a seed and
reading different parts of the permutation.



## How does this even work?

We use an [affine cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_cipher)
to generate different permutations of a domain.
It maps an index `i` to `(i * prime + offset) % domain`,
where `domain` is the size of the range of integers.
If we select `prime` to be coprime with `domain`, then this function is
bijective, i.e., for every output in the desired range, there exists exactly
one input from the same range that maps to it.

This means we can directly calculate any index or slice of a permutation.
It also means that the result does not have the same quality as a true shuffle,
hence shuffl-_ish_.
It will also only ever generate a small fraction of all possible permutations.
And while the generated permutations look random at first glance, they do not
fool proper randomness tests like [PractRand](https://pracrand.sourceforge.net/).
As a workaround, we added the
[local_shuffle()](https://shufflish.readthedocs.io/stable/api_reference.html#shufflish.local_shuffle)
function, which reads small chunks from some iterable and performs a true
shuffle on them.
This _mostly_ fools PractRand for chunk sizes as low as 16k.



## Basic usage

To obtain a permutation for some domain, simply call the
[permutation()](https://shufflish.readthedocs.io/stable/api_reference.html#shufflish.permutation)
function.
It determines suitable parameters and returns an
[AffineCipher](https://shufflish.readthedocs.io/stable/api_reference.html#shufflish.AffineCipher)
instance.
The most important parameters are the ``domain`` that sets the range of integers,
and an optional ``seed`` value.
If no seed is provided, a random value is chosen instead.
Based on the seed, ``num_primes`` (default 3) values are chosen from a list of ``primes``
([default](https://shufflish.readthedocs.io/stable/api_reference.html#shufflish.PRIMES)
are the 100 largest primes less than 2^64).

The returned object is iterable, sliceable, and indexable, exactly like a list or array.
For example, with ``domain=10`` and ``seed=42``:

```Python
from shufflish import permutation
p = permutation(10, 42)

for i in p:
    print(i)

print(list(p))
print(list(p[3:8]))
print(p[3])
```

Also note the strategic use of
[list](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list).
Where multiple values can be returned, iterators are used to conserve memory.


## Advanced usage

Affine ciphers are invertible (they would be bad ciphers if they were not).
You can use
[AffineCipher.invert](https://shufflish.readthedocs.io/stable/api_reference.html#shufflish.AffineCipher.invert)
to obtain the inverse chipher.

```Python
from shufflish import permutation
p = permutation(10, 42)
ip = p.invert()

for i in range(10):
    assert ip[p[i]] == i
```

Note that, while you can invert a slice of a chipher, this effectively swaps
the meaning of index and value, i.e., if p[x]=v then ip[v]=x.
Since slice start/stop/step lose their meaning after inversion,
[AffineCipher.invert](https://shufflish.readthedocs.io/stable/api_reference.html#shufflish.AffineCipher.invert)
ignores them and thus ``p[:10].invert()`` produces the same result as ``p.invert()``.

The extended Euclidean algorithm is used to obtain the multiplicative inverse,
which has a complexity of _O(log(N))_.
In practice this takes anywhere from 4 to 10 times as long as getting one
value from the cipher when first called.
The inverse is then cached inside the
[AffineCipher](https://shufflish.readthedocs.io/stable/api_reference.html#shufflish.AffineCipher)
instance,
so subsequent calls will be very fast.
Even the first call is still considerably faster than
[random.randrange()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randrange),
so it is probably not worth worrying about.



## Creating many permutations

One performance caveat is that the
[permutation()](https://shufflish.readthedocs.io/stable/api_reference.html#shufflish.permutation)
function needs to determine the correct coprime value for the seed.
By default, it uses a combination of ``num_primes=3`` primes
and skips repetitions mod ``domain``.
As you can imagine, this can take a little while.
If you need to create many permutations for the same domain,
consider using the
[Permutations](https://shufflish.readthedocs.io/stable/api_reference.html#shufflish.Permutations)
class instead.
It computes and stores all valid coprimes upon initialization,
which makes getting permutations effectively instantaneous.
Note that the coprimes array can use up to 1.3 MiB of memory with the default
settings, though it will be shared between instances with identical parameters.

Once you have your instance, using it is straightforward:

```python
from shufflish import Permutations
perms = Permutations(10)
p = perms.get(seed=42)

for i in p:
    print(i)

print(list(p))
print(list(p[3:8]))
print(p[3])
```

Alternatively, you can set ``allow_repetition=True`` to skip detection of repetitions.
The
[permutation()](https://shufflish.readthedocs.io/stable/api_reference.html#shufflish.permutation)
function can then determine the correct combination of primes much faster
(using combinatorial unraking), with the caveat that there is now a small chance
that permutations are repeated early.
Empirically, we find that repetitions occur at the earliest after ``domain`` seeds.



## Project status

Shufflish is currently in **alpha**.
You can expect permutations to be correct and complete, but updates may
change which permutation is generated for a given set of parameters.
For instance, the algorithm that determines the affine cipher's parameters
based on the seed may change, e.g., to reduce collisions.
Though unlikely, the API may also change if it proves annoying to use.
Once the project reaches a stable state, we will guarantee API stability and
that a set of parameters always produces the same permutation.
