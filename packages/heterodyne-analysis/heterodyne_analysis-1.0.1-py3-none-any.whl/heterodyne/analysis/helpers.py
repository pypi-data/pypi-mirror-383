Analysis Helper Functions
=========================

Utility functions for result interpretation, quality assessment, and
analysis support for the heterodyne analysis package.

This module contains standalone helper functions that provide interpretation
and quality assessment for analysis results.

    The reduced chi-squared uncertainty quantifies the reliability of the average:
    - Small uncertainty (< 0.1 * χ²_red): Consistent fit quality across angles
    - Moderate uncertainty (0.1-0.5 * χ²_red): Some angle variation, generally acceptable
    - Large uncertainty (> 0.5 * χ²_red): High variability between angles, potential systematic issues

    Parameters
    ----------
    chi2_value : float
        Reduced chi-squared value

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Interpretation string with quality assessment and statistical meaning
