Security Guidelines
===================

The heterodyne package implements comprehensive security measures to ensure safe and reliable operation. This document outlines our security practices and guidelines for developers.

Security Tools Integration
---------------------------

**Automated Security Scanning**

The package includes integrated security scanning tools:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Security linting with Bandit
   bandit -r heterodyne/ --configfile pyproject.toml

   # Dependency vulnerability scanning with pip-audit
   pip-audit --requirement requirements.txt

**Bandit Configuration**

Our Bandit configuration in ``pyproject.toml`` is specifically tuned for scientific Python packages:

.. code-block:: toml

   [tool.bandit]
   exclude_dirs = ["heterodyne/tests", "tests", "build", "dist"]
   skips = [
       "B101",  # Skip assert_used test (common in scientific code)
       "B110",  # Skip try_except_pass (used for graceful degradation)
       "B403",  # Skip pickle import (required for data serialization)
       "B404",  # Skip subprocess import (required for CLI completion and test runner)
       "B603",  # Skip subprocess without shell (we control the input)
   ]
   severity_level = "medium"  # Only report medium and high severity issues

Security Best Practices
------------------------

**1. Dependency Management**

- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning with pip-audit
- Pinned version ranges for critical dependencies
- Optional dependency groups to minimize attack surface
- Clean separation of development and production dependencies

**2. File Operations**

- No hardcoded file paths - all paths are user-configurable
- Secure file operations with proper error handling
- Input validation for all file paths and configuration parameters
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

**3. Subprocess Usage**

When subprocess operations are required (CLI completion, test runner):

- Input validation for all command arguments
- No shell=True usage - direct command execution only
- Timeout controls for external processes
- Proper error handling and resource cleanup

**4. Data Serialization**

- Pickle usage limited to internal data structures only
- No deserialization of untrusted data
- Clear documentation of serialization boundaries
- Alternative serialization options where feasible

**5. Configuration Security**

- Configuration validation with schema checking
- No secrets or sensitive data in configuration files
- Environment variable support for sensitive parameters
- Input sanitization for all user-provided configuration

Testing Security
-----------------

**Security Testing Workflow**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run all security checks
   bandit -r heterodyne/ --configfile pyproject.toml
   pip-audit --requirement requirements.txt

   # Check for hardcoded secrets
   bandit -r heterodyne/ -f json | grep -i password,secret,token,key

   # Verify no high-severity issues
   bandit -r heterodyne/ --severity-level high

**Continuous Security**

- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines
- Regular dependency updates with security patch monitoring
- Pre-commit hooks for security linting
- Security review process for new features

Reporting Security Issues
-------------------------

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: wchen@anl.gov
3. Include detailed description and reproduction steps
4. Allow reasonable time for response and patch development

Security Architecture
---------------------

**Threat Model**

The heterodyne package operates with the following security assumptions:

- **Trusted Environment**: Runs in researcher-controlled computational environments
- **Data Integrity**: Scientific data integrity is paramount
- **No Network Operations**: Package does not perform network requests
- **Local File Access**: Requires access only to user-specified data files

**Security Boundaries**

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated at entry points
- **Configuration Isolation**: Configuration files cannot execute code
- **Data Processing**: Mathematical operations isolated from system operations
- **Output Generation**: Results written only to user-specified directories

**Security Controls**

1. **Static Analysis**: Bandit security linting with scientific code patterns
2. **Dependency Scanning**: pip-audit for known vulnerabilities
3. **Input Validation**: Schema-based configuration validation
4. **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information disclosure
5. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and resource limits

Compliance and Standards
------------------------

The package follows security best practices for scientific software:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Applied where applicable to scientific software
- **OWASP Top 10**: Mitigated risks relevant to data processing applications
- **Scientific Software Security**: Industry best practices for computational research

**Security Metrics**

Current security status:

- ✅ **0 high-severity security issues** (Bandit scanning)
- ✅ **0 known vulnerabilities** in dependencies (pip-audit)
- ✅ **100% security tool compliance** in CI/CD
- ✅ **Secure development practices** documented and followed

Contributing Security
----------------------

**Security Review Process**

All contributions undergo security review:

1. Automated security scanning (Bandit, pip-audit)
2. Code review focusing on security implications
3. Testing of new security-relevant features
4. Documentation updates for security-related changes

**Developer Security Guidelines**

When contributing:

- Follow secure coding practices outlined in this document
- Run security checks before submitting PRs
- Document any security implications of new features
- Consider impact on existing security boundaries

.. code-block:: bash

   # Pre-submission security checklist
   bandit -r heterodyne/ --configfile pyproject.toml
   pip-audit
   # Verify no secrets in code
   git diff --staged | grep -iE '(password|secret|token|key|api)'
