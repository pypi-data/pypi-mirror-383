To use this module, you need to:

- Go to Sales > Orders > Quotations

- Create a quotation. Set a customer, a product and a payment term.

- Confirm the quotation.

- Create a second quotation with the same data as above and set a different payment term.

- Confirm the second quotation.

- Go back to the Quotations list view and select the two newly created sales orders.

- Click on the Action button and select Create Invoices.

- In the wizard click on Create and View Invoice.

- Even though both quotations have almost the same data, the invoicing has been split into two invoices because they have different payment terms.
