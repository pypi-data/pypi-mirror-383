# OpenFatture v1.1.0 – English-First Experience

**Release date:** 12 October 2025 • **Status:** Stable

This release aligns OpenFatture with an English-first product experience across the CLI, interactive flows, and customer-facing assets. It also standardises the payment import command naming and refreshes every documentation touchpoint.

## Highlights

- **Unified messaging:** All CLI prompts, interactive screens, payment reminders, and PDF exports now ship in English to match the updated reference manuals.
- **Documentation refresh:** README, quickstarts, knowledge base blueprints, and storyboard walkthroughs have been rewritten to reflect the new tone and workflow guidance.
- **Automation tapes updated:** Media automation scripts and `.tape` recordings were regenerated to capture the revised prompts and UI copy.

## Breaking Changes

- The payment CLI now exposes `openfatture payment import` as the canonical command. The legacy alias `import-statement` has been removed—update any saved scripts or automations accordingly.

## Upgrade Checklist

```bash
git pull origin main
uv sync
uv run openfatture --version  # should report OpenFatture v1.1.0
```

If you rely on scripted payment imports, replace usages of `openfatture payment import-statement` with `openfatture payment import`.

## Validation

- `uv run python -m pytest`
- Optional: re-run media automation (`make media-record`) to regenerate scenario assets if you maintain customised demos.

## Documentation

- Main README: English-first highlights and updated version badge.
- Docs hub (`docs/README.md`): refreshed navigation with the new release and ongoing v1.0.1 AI upgrade.
- Release archive: [v1.0.0 – Release Notes](v1.0.0.md), [v1.0.1 – AI Cash Flow Upgrade](v1.0.1.md).
