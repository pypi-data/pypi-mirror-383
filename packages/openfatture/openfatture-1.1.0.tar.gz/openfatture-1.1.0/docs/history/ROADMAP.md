- Domain models for Cliente, Fattura, LineaFattura and related services.
- SQLAlchemy ORM with initial migrations and fixtures.
- Pydantic-based configuration system with `.env` support.

### ✅ Phase 2 – SDI Integration (Completed)

**Status:** 100% complete • **Completion:** October 2025 • **Coverage:** 80%

Key achievements:
- FatturaPA XML v1.9 generator with validation against official schemas.

### ✅ Phase 3 – CLI & User Experience (Completed)

**Status:** 100% complete
CLI-first experience now available both as scripted commands and interactive TUI.

Highlights:
- Typer command tree (init, config, cliente, fattura, pec, email, notifiche, batch, report, ai, payment, interactive).
- Questionary/Rich-powered menus with fuzzy search, shortcuts, progress bars.
- Autocomplete helpers for provinces, codici SDI, nature VAT, service descriptions.
- `openfatture --install-completion` for bash/zsh/fish shell completions.
- PDF generation for human-readable invoices (`openfatture fattura pdf`) with three templates (Minimalist, Professional, Branded) conforming to PDF/A-3.
- Enhanced dashboard in interactive mode with AI chat integration.

✅ Remaining UX improvements (filtering widgets, live metrics) are tracked as backlog items for Phase 6.

---

### 🚧 Phase 4 – AI Layer (In Progress ~70%)

**Goal:** Transform AI stubs into production-grade agents.

✅ Delivered:
- Provider abstraction (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) with streaming, token counting, cost tracking and configurable caching.
- Functional agents: InvoiceAssistant (`ai describe`), TaxAdvisor (`ai suggest-vat`), ChatAssistant (interactive chat with tool calling).
- Tool registry with six production tools for invoices/client search and analytics.
- Session persistence with export (JSON/Markdown) and cost telemetry.
- RAG subsystem (ChromaDB backing store) with CLI management (`ai rag status/index/search`) and automated snippet injection in Chat/Tax flows.
- PaymentInsightAgent for causale analysis during reconciliation.
- Cash Flow Predictor (`ai forecast`) – Prophet + XGBoost ensemble con artefatti persistenti, metriche salvate e comando `--retrain`.

🚧 Pending for Phase 4.3-4.4:
- Compliance Checker (`ai check`) – SDI preflight checks with severity/mitigation hints.
- LangGraph-powered multi-agent workflows (invoice → tax → compliance orchestration).
- Provider-level rate limiting, semantic caching fallback, advanced cost analytics.
- Full integration tests against local Ollama (CI) and property-based tests for prompts.

---

### ✅ Phase 5 – Payment Module & Bank Reconciliation (Completed)

**Released with v1.0.0**

Highlights:
- `openfatture.payment` module with DDD/hexagonal architecture (domain aggregates, services, repositories).
- Multi-format bank importers (CSV presets, OFX, QIF) with deduplication and preset management.
- Matching engine with composite strategies (exact, fuzzy, IBAN, date window) and confidence scoring.
- Ledger for partial allocations plus transaction lifecycle management (UNMATCHED → MATCHED → IGNORED).
- Payment reminders with configurable strategies (DEFAULT, PROGRESSIVE, AGGRESSIVE, CUSTOM) and multi-channel notifications (email/SMS/webhook).
- CLI toolset (`openfatture payment ...`) for import, review, reconciliation, reminders.
- Unified payment due insights across CLI (`report scadenze`) and TUI dashboard.

📈 Quality: 74 dedicated tests for the payment module, bringing overall coverage above 85%.

### 🚀 Phase 6 – Production & Advanced Capabilities (Planned)

**Focus areas for 2026:**
- **Production deployment:** hardened Docker images, health checks, observability stack, backup/disaster recovery automation.
- **CI/CD:** release automation, PyPI publishing, staging smoke tests, rollback workflows.
- **Accounting integrations:** accountant-friendly exports (CSV/XLSX/XML), connectors to third-party software, payment gateway integrations.
- **Web experience:** optional FastAPI backend + SPA frontend with realtime updates.
- **Performance & scale:** query optimisation, caching (Redis), load testing, multi-tenant support.
- **Compliance:** GDPR audit, long-term preservation strategy, security hardening.

## Known Placeholders & Follow-Ups

| Area | File | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Cash flow forecasting CLI | `openfatture/cli/commands/ai.py` | ⏳ Stub | `openfatture ai forecast` prints placeholder; awaiting Phase 4.3 model. |
| Compliance checker CLI | `openfatture/cli/commands/ai.py` | ⏳ Stub | `openfatture ai check` returns placeholder response; agent under development. |
| LangGraph orchestration | `openfatture/ai/orchestration/*` | ⏳ Scaffold | Workflow states defined, execution still to be wired into UI/CLI. |

---

## Dependency Outlook

- ✅ **ChromaDB** – in production for RAG indexing/search.
- ✅ **ReportLab** – used for PDF invoice generation.
- ⏳ **LangGraph** – installed, to be activated with multi-agent workflows in Phase 4.4.

---

## Success Criteria & Metrics

- **Compliance:** Keep FatturaPA/SDI compatibility up to date (audited each release).
- **Quality:** Incrementare la copertura (gate CI ≥60% in v1.0.2, obiettivo 85% a medio termine); ampliare i test quando arrivano nuovi moduli.
- **AI adoption:** ≥60% of active users leverage AI features; monitor cost per AI-assisted invoice (<€0.10 target).
- **Payments:** ≥95% reconciliation accuracy per banca supportata con reminder affidabili.
- **Documentation:** Update `docs/README.md`, release notes, and roadmap at every tagged release.
