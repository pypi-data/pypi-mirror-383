- Tool registry with six production tools for invoices/client search and analytics.
- Session persistence with export (JSON/Markdown) and cost telemetry.
- RAG subsystem (ChromaDB backing store) with CLI management (`ai rag status/index/search`) and automated snippet injection in Chat/Tax flows.
- PaymentInsightAgent for causale analysis during reconciliation.
- Cash Flow Predictor (`ai forecast`) ‚Äì Prophet + XGBoost ensemble con artefatti persistenti, metriche salvate e comando `--retrain`.

üöß Pending for Phase 4.3-4.4:
- Compliance Checker (`ai check`) ‚Äì SDI preflight checks with severity/mitigation hints.
- LangGraph-powered multi-agent workflows (invoice ‚Üí tax ‚Üí compliance orchestration).
- Provider-level rate limiting, semantic caching fallback, advanced cost analytics.
- Full integration tests against local Ollama (CI) and property-based tests for prompts.

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 5 ‚Äì Payment Module & Bank Reconciliation (Completed)

**Released with v1.0.0**

Highlights:
- `openfatture.payment` module with DDD/hexagonal architecture (domain aggregates, services, repositories).
- Multi-format bank importers (CSV presets, OFX, QIF) with deduplication and preset management.
- Matching engine with composite strategies (exact, fuzzy, IBAN, date window) and confidence scoring.
- Ledger for partial allocations plus transaction lifecycle management (UNMATCHED ‚Üí MATCHED ‚Üí IGNORED).
- Payment reminders with configurable strategies (DEFAULT, PROGRESSIVE, AGGRESSIVE, CUSTOM) and multi-channel notifications (email/SMS/webhook).
- CLI toolset (`openfatture payment ...`) for import, review, reconciliation, reminders.
- Unified payment due insights across CLI (`report scadenze`) and TUI dashboard.

üìà Quality: 74 dedicated tests for the payment module, bringing overall coverage above 85%.

### üöÄ Phase 6 ‚Äì Production & Advanced Capabilities (Planned)

**Focus areas for 2026:**
- **Production deployment:** hardened Docker images, health checks, observability stack, backup/disaster recovery automation.
- **CI/CD:** release automation, PyPI publishing, staging smoke tests, rollback workflows.
- **Accounting integrations:** accountant-friendly exports (CSV/XLSX/XML), connectors to third-party software, payment gateway integrations.
- **Web experience:** optional FastAPI backend + SPA frontend with realtime updates.
- **Performance & scale:** query optimisation, caching (Redis), load testing, multi-tenant support.
- **Compliance:** GDPR audit, long-term preservation strategy, security hardening.
