## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or later
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- PEC mailbox credentials (for SDI delivery)

### Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gianlucamazza/openfatture.git
cd openfatture
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
```

Populate `.env` with company data, PEC credentials, and notification settings (see `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`), then initialise the database:

```bash
uv run python -c "from openfatture.storage.database.session import init_db; init_db()"
```

### Next Steps

- Review the complete CLI catalogue in `docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md`.
- Explore `docs/PAYMENT_TRACKING.md` to master reconciliation and reminders.

invoice = Fattura(...)  # See QUICKSTART for complete examples
xml_tree = FatturaXMLGenerator(invoice).generate()
TemplatePECSender(settings=get_settings()).send_invoice_to_sdi(
    invoice,
    xml_path="invoice.xml",
