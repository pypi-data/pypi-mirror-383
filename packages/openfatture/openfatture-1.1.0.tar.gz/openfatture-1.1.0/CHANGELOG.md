## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-12
### Changed
- Localised the CLI, interactive experience, email templates, and PDF outputs to English for consistency across platforms.
- Updated documentation, quickstarts, automation tapes, and examples to reflect global English-first messaging.

### Removed

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-10

### Added
- **Payment Tracking Module** - Enterprise-grade bank reconciliation system:

  **Domain Models**:
  - `BankAccount`: Multi-account support with IBAN validation
  - `BankTransaction`: Full transaction lifecycle (UNMATCHED → MATCHED → IGNORED)
  - `PaymentReminder`: Automated payment tracking with configurable strategies
  - Value Objects: `MatchResult`, `ReconciliationResult` for type-safe operations
  - Enums: `TransactionStatus`, `MatchType`, `ReminderStatus`, `ReminderStrategy`

  **Application Services**:
  - `MatchingService`: Intelligent payment matching with pluggable algorithms (Facade pattern)
  - `ReconciliationService`: Saga-based workflow for multi-step reconciliation
  - `ReminderScheduler`: Automated payment reminder system with escalation strategies

  **Matching Strategies** (Strategy pattern):
  - `ExactAmountMatcher`: Amount + date window matching (configurable tolerance)
  - `FuzzyDescriptionMatcher`: NLP-based description matching with Levenshtein distance
  - `IBANMatcher`: Direct IBAN/BIC validation for wire transfers
  - `DateWindowMatcher`: Flexible date range matching
  - `CompositeMatcher`: Weighted combination of multiple strategies

  **Import Infrastructure**:
  - Bank statement importers: CSV (Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit, Revolut), OFX, QIF
  - Factory pattern for format detection
  - Bank-specific presets with field mapping
  - Transaction deduplication and validation

  **Notification System** (Strategy + Composite patterns):
  - `EmailNotifier`: SMTP with Jinja2 templates (HTML + text fallback)
  - `ConsoleNotifier`: Development/testing output
  - `CompositeNotifier`: Multi-channel notifications (email + SMS + webhook)
  - Configurable SMTP settings with TLS support

  **Reminder Strategies**:
  - `DEFAULT`: Single reminder at due date
  - `PROGRESSIVE`: Escalating reminders (-7, -3, 0, +3, +7 days)
  - `AGGRESSIVE`: Frequent follow-ups for high-risk clients
  - `CUSTOM`: User-defined reminder schedules

  **CLI Interface** (`openfatture payment`):
  - `import`: Bulk transaction import with progress tracking
  - `list-transactions`: Paginated transaction browser with filters
  - `reconcile`: Interactive matching with confidence scores
  - `review`: Review queue for medium-confidence matches
  - `batch-reconcile`: Automated high-confidence reconciliation
  - `ignore`/`reset`: Transaction state management
  - `reminders`: Schedule and manage payment reminders

  **Testing & Quality**:

  - 100% test pass rate
  - 82-96% code coverage on critical services
  - Property-based testing with Hypothesis
  - Integration tests with real database workflows
  - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions (multi-OS, multi-Python)

  **Architecture**:
  - Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
  - Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with aggregates and entities
  - SOLID principles throughout
  - Design patterns: Strategy, Saga, Facade, Composite, Factory
  - Type-safe with full mypy compliance
