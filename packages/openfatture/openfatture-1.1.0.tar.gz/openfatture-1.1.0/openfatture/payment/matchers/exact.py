    This strategy provides the highest confidence (1.0) for matches because:
    - Amount must match exactly (within 1 cent for rounding)
    - Date must be within ±3 days of payment due date
    - No fuzzy logic involved

    Perfect for:
    - Automated reconciliation without human review
    - High-volume transaction processing
    - When bank descriptions are unreliable

    Attributes:
        date_tolerance_days: Number of days before/after due date to consider (default 3)

        >>> matcher = ExactAmountMatcher(date_tolerance_days=5)
        >>> results = matcher.match(transaction, payments)
        >>> if results and results[0].confidence == 1.0:
