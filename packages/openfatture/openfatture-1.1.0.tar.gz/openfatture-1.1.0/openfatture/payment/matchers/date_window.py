    This strategy is useful when:
    - Payments may be delayed by a few days
    - Bank processing time varies
    - Due dates are approximate

    Differs from ExactAmountMatcher:
    - Wider date window (default ±7 days vs ±3 days)
    - Variable confidence based on date proximity
    - More lenient amount tolerance

    Confidence Scoring:
    - Same date → confidence 0.85
    - ±1 day → confidence 0.80
    - ±2-3 days → confidence 0.75
    - ±4-5 days → confidence 0.70
