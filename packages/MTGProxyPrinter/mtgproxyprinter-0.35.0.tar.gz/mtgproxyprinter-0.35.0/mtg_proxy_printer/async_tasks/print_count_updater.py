    This class updates the print counts stored in the database.

    Implementation note: Why is this an async task, even though it only takes a few milliseconds to complete?
    Answer: This encapsulates the database writing work associated with printing, allowing the application to delay
    the execution of the database write transaction arbitrarily without stalling the main thread.
    This allows the app to offer printing while a card data update writes to the card database,
    which can take multiple minutes if the network connection is sufficiently slow.
    If it were synchronous, printing would block the UI thread until the update completes,
    or the app would miss writing the data at all, or printing/PDF export had to be prohibited.
