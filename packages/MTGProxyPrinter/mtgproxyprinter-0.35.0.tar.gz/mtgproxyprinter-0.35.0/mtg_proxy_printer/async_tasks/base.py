# Design

- Async background tasks are classes that use a custom base class (AsyncTask)
  derived from QObject to inherit Qt's Signal & Slot mechanism, and a fixed API to launch them
- The AsyncTask base class holds Qt signals for progress reporting, and are started by the tasks run() method. Signals are:
  - Starting a task with expected task size and UI string to display
  - advancing a task by 1, or setting progress to any number
  - finishing a task with ability to re-start
  - and removing a finished task completely.
- AsyncTasks can have nested sub-tasks. These are synchronous within the task, but can report individual progress.
  - Example: A sequence of card image downloads can be triggered by a document load or deck list import
- Cancelable async tasks have can_cancel() return True
  - For these, a cancel button is shown next to the progress bar
  - Triggering the cancel button is connected to the cancel() slot. How that cancels the operation is up to the task
- A method in the Application class handles launching them
  - It wraps them in the AsyncTaskRunner QRunnable subclass
  - Registers it in the ProgressBarManager to create progress bar for it to display progress
  - Then pushes the task into the global QThreadPool
- The ProgressBarManager sets up a progress bar widget in the main window status bar,
  and connects the tasks progress signals with the appropriate slots

# TODO: 
- Some export tasks require locking the UI, because they take time during which the document must be immutable.
- Implement tasks that lock the UI
  - Add `is_locking: bool` to the AsyncTask class.
  - Default to False
  - If True, lock the main window UI when such a task starts, and unlock when it finishes
  - To be completely safe, use a Semaphore or similar to count the number of active UI locks,
    and unlock when the lock count is zero.
  - Locking can use the normal progress signals. When `is_locking` is True, simply connect the begin_progress and 
    finish_progress signals to the lock/unlock methods. The task dispatch method can handle those connections
