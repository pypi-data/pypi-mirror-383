# Daddy's Boring Math Library

Collection of Python PyPI projects of a mathematical nature.
It's purpose is to host and provide infrastructure for my
Python mathematical hobby projects.

The overall project's name is **Boring Math** and consists of PyPI
projects with PyPI and GitHub names beginning "boring-math-". All
projects are all under the `boring_math` Python namespace.

For more information visit the project's
[homepage](https://grscheller.github.io/boring-math/).

## Boring Math projects

| Name | PyPI | GitHub | Docs | Python Package |
|:---- |:----:|:------:|:----:|:-------------- |
| Combinatorics | [boring-math-combinatorics][101] | [gh][201] | [gh_pages][301] | boring_math.combinatorics |
| Number Theory | [boring-math-number-theory][102] | [gh][202] | [gh_pages][302] | boring_math.number_theory |
| Prob Distributions | [boring-math-probability-distributions][103] | [gh][203] | [gh_pages][303] | boring_math.probability_distributions |
| Pythagorean Triples | [boring-math-pythagorean-triples][104] | [gh][204] | [gh_pages][304] | boring_math.pythagorean_triples |
| Recursive Functions | [boring-math-recursive-functions][105] | [gh][205] | [gh_pages][305] | boring_math.recursive_functions |
| Special Functions | [boring-math-special-functions][106] | [gh][206] | [gh_pages][306] | boring_math.special_functions |

These are fun little math projects which I enjoy doing. They have many
loose threads. They are as much for me to learn Python as they are for
me to play with math.
