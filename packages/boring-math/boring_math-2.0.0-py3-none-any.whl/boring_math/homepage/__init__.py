"""
Purpose boring-math PyPI Project
================================

The boring-math PyPI project is a central component of my
Boring Math hobby projects.

- It is the PyPI project for the ``boring_math.homepage`` module.
- Claims the boring-math name on PyPI for the overall effort.
- Hosts on *GitHub Pages*

  - The Boring Math homepage.
  - Sphinx API & usage documentation for each Boring Math project.

- Provides locations for overarching CHANGELOG and README files.

  - Each Boring Math project has its own CHANGELOG and README files.

.. tip::

    There is no need to install boring-math itself, but does not hurt
    anything if it is installed.
