Idea:

1. main function takes in:
    a. patch file
    b. list of files to split out
2. reads patch file, splits based on file headers (assumed to be valid)
3. for each file being patched:
    a. if the file is in the list, send its hunks to output 1
    b. otherwise send its hunks to output 2
    c. hunks include all header lines so each output is a valid diff

Could share some functionality with refactored, modular version of fix_patch

    """
    Split a patch into two parts based on a list of files to include.

    Parameters
    ----------
    patch_lines : List[str]
        Lines of the patch file to split.
    files_to_include : List[str]
        List of file paths (relative, starting with ./) to include in the first output.
        Files not in this list go to the second output.

    Returns
    -------
    included_lines : List[str]
        Lines for the patch containing only the included files.
    excluded_lines : List[str]
        Lines for the patch containing all other files.

    Notes
    -----
    The function preserves all header information for each file's hunks
    to ensure both output patches are valid. File paths are normalized
    to start with './' for comparison purposes.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the patch format is invalid or cannot be parsed.
