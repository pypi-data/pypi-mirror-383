### Installation

### Basic Usage

```bash
# AI-powered commit with automatic message generation
tgit commit

tgit version

### Configuration

The easiest way to configure TGIT is through the interactive settings command:

tgit settings

This will guide you through setting up:

- OpenAI API key for AI-powered commits

- Commit emoji preferences
- Custom commit types

Alternatively, you can manually create a `.tgit.yaml` file in your project root or `~/.tgit.yaml` for global settings:

```yaml
apiKey: "your-openai-api-key"
model: "gpt-5-mini"
commit:
  emoji: true
  types:
    - type: "feat"
      emoji: "✨"
    - type: "fix"
      emoji: "🐛"
```

# AI-powered commit
