you're working on an experimental feature that didn't get the proper ticketing and pr stuff set up.

assuming you just made a commit, here are the next steps:


1. get the sha of the commit you just made (if you didn't make one, read `.claude/commands/commit.md` and make one)

2. Think deeply about what you just implemented, then create a GitHub issue about what you just did using `gh issue create`. It should have sections for "Problem to Solve" and "Proposed Solution"
3. Get the issue number from the created issue
4. git checkout main
5. git checkout -b 'BRANCHNAME'
6. git cherry-pick 'COMMITHASH'
7. git push -u origin 'BRANCHNAME'
8. gh pr create --fill
9. read '.claude/commands/describe_pr.md' and follow the instructions
