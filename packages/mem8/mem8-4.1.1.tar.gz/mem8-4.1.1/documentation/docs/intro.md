# Welcome to Codebase Context

**Tools and Techniques for AI Development Workflows**

Codebase Context is a collection of tools and approaches for managing AI context windows, memory, and development workflows. mem8 is the primary CLI tool that helps bridge the gaps between AI capabilities and developer needs.

:::info Historical Note
The original [codebase-context-spec](https://github.com/Agentic-Insights/codebase-context-spec) project is **archived and no longer maintained or supported**. mem8 represents the current, actively developed implementation of these concepts.

## What is mem8?

mem8 addresses common challenges in AI-assisted development:

- 🧠 **Context Window Management** - Persistent memory across long development sessions
- 📝 **Structured Thoughts** - Organize research, plans, and decisions in searchable markdown
- 🔧 **Toolbelt Integration** - Install and manage development tools seamlessly
- 🚢 **Port Management** - Intelligent detection and resolution of port conflicts
- 🤖 **Claude Code Enhancement** - Custom agents, commands, and workflows
- 🎨 **External Templates** - Start projects with team-standardized configurations
- 🔍 **Universal Search** - Find information across all your documentation

## Quick Example

```bash
# Install mem8
uv tool install mem8

# Initialize with official templates
mem8 init --template-source killerapp/mem8-templates

# Or use your team's custom templates
mem8 init --template-source yourorg/team-templates

# Search your memory
mem8 search "authentication"

# Check workspace status
mem8 status
```
