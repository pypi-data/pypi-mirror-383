def _copyfile_to_upload_server(filepath, local_path=None, server_path = None,overwrite = False):
    '''

    This is an internal function, not meant to be called by the end user, call copy_to_upload_server instead.

    This is a support function that will copy data between computers; it will not overwrite, unless forced.
    
    It will raise an exception if the files are already there unless overwrite is true.
    
    Does not insert to the Upload table.


    Parameters
    ----------
    filepath : str or Path
        Path to the file to copy, relative to local_path
    local_path : str or Path, optional
        Source directory containing the file. If None, uses first path from preferences
    server_path : str or Path, optional
        Destination directory to copy to. If None, uses upload_path from preferences
    overwrite : bool, default False
        Whether to overwrite existing files at the destination

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Dictionary containing:
        - src_path: Relative path to the file
        - src_md5: MD5 hash of the file
        - src_size: Size of the file in bytes 
        - src_datetime: Creation timestamp of the file

    Raises
    ------
    OSError
        If filepath is a directory
        If destination file exists and overwrite=False
        If copy operation fails

    clean_local_path(local_path = None, filterkeys = [], dry_run = False)

    Remove local files that are already in the database from a local path
    Clean local files that have already been uploaded to the database.
    
    This function checks files in a local directory against the database and removes
    local copies that have already been successfully uploaded (verified by MD5 checksum).
    
    Files are only deleted if they exist in either the File or ProcessedFile tables
      AND their MD5 checksums match exactly
    
    Files with mismatched checksums are kept and reported
    
    Empty directories are not automatically removed (TODO)

    Parameters
    ----------
    local_path : str or Path, optional
        Path to local directory to clean. If None, uses first path from preferences.
    filterkeys : list, optional
        List of strings to filter filenames by. Only files containing all filterkeys will be checked.
    dry_run : bool, optional
        If True, only prints what would be deleted without actually deleting files.
        
    Returns
    -------
    deleted : list
        List of files that were deleted (or would be deleted in dry_run mode)
    keep : list 
        List of files that were kept because their checksums did not match the database
