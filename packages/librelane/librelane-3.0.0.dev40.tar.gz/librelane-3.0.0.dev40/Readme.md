LibreLane is an ASIC infrastructure library based on several components including
OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, KLayout and a number of custom scripts for
design exploration and optimization, currently developed and maintained by
members and affiliates of the
[American University in Cairo Open Hardware Lab](https://github.com/aucohl)
under the stewardship of the [FOSSi Foundation](https://fossi-foundation.org).

A reference flow, "Classic", performs all ASIC implementation steps from RTL all
the way down to GDSII.

You can find the documentation
[here](https://librelane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/) to get
started. You can discuss LibreLane in the
[FOSSi Chat Matrix Server](https://fossi-chat.org).


## Try it out

You can try LibreLane right in your browser, free-of-charge, using Google
Colaboratory by following
[**this link**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/librelane/librelane/blob/main/notebook.ipynb).

## Installation

You'll need the following:

* Python **3.10** or higher with PIP, Venv and Tkinter

### Nix (Recommended)

Works for macOS and Linux (x86-64 and aarch64). Recommended, as it is more
integrated with your filesystem and overall has less upload and download deltas.

See
[Nix-based installation](https://librelane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/common/nix_installation/index.html)
in the docs for more info.

### Docker

Works for Windows, macOS and Linux (x86-64 and aarch64).

See
[Docker-based installation](https://librelane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/common/docker_installation/index.html)
in the docs for more info.

Do note you'll need to add `--dockerized` right after `librelane` in most CLI
invocations.

### Python-only Installation (Advanced, Not Recommended)

**You'll need to bring your own compiled utilities**, but otherwise, simply
install LibreLane as follows:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade librelane
```

Python-only installations are presently unsupported and entirely at your own
risk.

## Usage

In the root folder of the repository, you may invoke:

```sh
python3 -m librelane --pdk-root <path/to/pdk> </path/to/config.json>
```

To start with, you can try:

```sh
python3 -m librelane --pdk-root $HOME/.ciel ./designs/spm/config.json
```
