Introduction
------------

PumpIA is a python framework designed to allow users to visualise the analysis of images through a user interface.
It does not do any image analysis itself, but rather provides a platform for users to write their own analysis code and view the results.
This means that the full power of python and its libraries are available to the user.

See documentation at [PumpIA](https://principle-five.github.io/pumpia/).

Please note there isn't a stable version (v1.0.0) yet, backwards compatibility breaks are instead denoted by the minor version.

Requirements
------------
PumpIA has been designed to use the minimum number of dependencies, so the user interface relies on tkinter.
PumpIA has the following dependencies:

* numpy
* scipy
* pillow
* pydicom
* matplotlib

Installation
------------

PumpIA requires python 3.12 or greater.
To use PumpIA, install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pumpia/) it using pip:

    pip install pumpia
