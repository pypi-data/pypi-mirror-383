class LangChainLlmFactory:
    """
    Interface for Factory classes creating LLM BaseLanguageModels

    Most methods take a config dictionary which consists of the following keys:

        "model_name"                The name of the model.
                                    Default if not specified is "gpt-3.5-turbo"

        "temperature"               A float "temperature" value with which to
                                    initialize the chat model.  In general,
                                    higher temperatures yield more random results.
                                    Default if not specified is 0.7

        "prompt_token_fraction"     The fraction of total tokens (not necessarily words
                                    or letters) to use for a prompt. Each model_name
                                    has a documented number of max_tokens it can handle
                                    which is a total count of message + response tokens
                                    which goes into the calculation involved in
                                    get_max_prompt_tokens().
                                    By default the value is 0.5.

        "max_tokens"                The maximum number of tokens to use in
                                    get_max_prompt_tokens(). By default this comes from
                                    the model description in this class.
