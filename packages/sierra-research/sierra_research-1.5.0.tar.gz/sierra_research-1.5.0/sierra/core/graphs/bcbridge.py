    Container of info for generating graphs from batch criteria.

    Attributes:
        cmdopts: Dictionary of parsed command line options. Most batch
                 criteria will not need this to compute things, BUT it is
                 available.

        batch_output_root: Root directory for all experimental output in the
                           batch. Needed in calculating graphs for batch
                           criteria when ``--exp-range`` is used.

        exp_names: The names of experiment directories to instantiate on the
                   filesystem.

        xticklabels: Labels for the xticks.

        xticks: The x-axis ticks.

        yticklabels: Labels for the yticks.

        yticks: The y-axis ticks.
