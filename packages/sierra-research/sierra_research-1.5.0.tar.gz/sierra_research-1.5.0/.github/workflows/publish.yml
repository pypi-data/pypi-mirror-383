description: Publish SIERRA to PyPI

# 2025-04-29 [JRH]: Note that per github actions guidance, the publish job has
# to be in a separate workflow than anything else; if it is in the same workflow
# it is unsupported/still might work.
#
# Note also that the 'published' release type will trigger for both prelease
# (what I call beta releases) and formal releases.
