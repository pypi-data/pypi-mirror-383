Runtime Directory Tree
======================

.. IMPORTANT:: SIERRA **NEVER** deletes directories for you.

   So, if a directory that SIERRA needs to create already exists during stage
   {1,2}, it will abort processing in order to preserve data integrity; this is
   not necessary to do for stages {3,4,5}, because those stages can be recreated
   using the results of stages {1,2}.  This behavior can be overwridden with
   ``--exp-overwrite``, in which case the user assumes full responsibility for
   ensuring the integrity of the experiment.

   Always better to check the arguments before hitting ENTER. Measure twice, cut
   once, as the saying goes.


Basic Structure
---------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Directory

     - Meaning

     - Configurable?

   * - SIERRA root

     - The root directory that SIERRA outputs EVERYTHING to. SIERRA will *read*
       configuration/inputs from where you tell it to, but all outputs generated
       during at any pipeline stage will appear under here.

     - `--sierra-root`. See :ref:`usage/cli` for more info.

   * - Batchroot

     - ALL files (generated experiment inputs, experiment outputs, deliverables,
       etc.) are written to this directory, which will be under
       ``--sierra-root``.  Named using a combination of:

       - ``--controller``
       - ``--scenario``
       - ``--sierra-root``
       - ``--expdef-template``
       - ``--batch-criteria``

       Subsequent experiments using the same values for these cmdline
       arguments **WILL** result in the same calculated root directory for
       experimental inputs and outputs, even if other parameters change (or if
       you change the contents of the template input file). This WILL result in
       SIERRA aborting processing during stages {1,2} if this occurs, as
       described above.

     - No.

   * - Batch input root

     - All experiment input files will be generated under this root
       directory.

     - No/named ``<batchroot>/exp-inputs``.

   * - Batch output root

     - All experiment output files in stage 2 will accrue under this root
       directory. Each experiment will get their own subdirectory in this root
       for its outputs to accrue into.

     - No/named ``<batchroot>/exp-outputs``.

   * - Batch scratch root.

     - All GNU parallel outputs, ``--execenv`` artifacts will appear under
       here. Each experiment will get their own directory in this root for their
       own scratch. This root is separate from experiment inputs to make
       checking for segfaults, tar-ing experiments, etc. easier.

     - No/named ``<batchroot>/scratch``.


Core Pipeline Directory Tree (Stages 1-2)
-----------------------------------------

When SIERRA runs stages 1-2, it creates a directory structure under whatever was
passed as ``--sierra-root``.  The specifics of what directories/files get
created *may* depend on the specific set of active plugins; see the :ref:`plugin
docs <plugins>` for details. However, the SIERRA core creates a consistent set
of directories during stages 1-2. for the purposes of explanation, I will use
the following partial SIERRA option set to explain the core experiment tree::

  --sierra-root=$HOME/exp\
  --controller=CATEGORY.my_controller\
  --scenario=SS.12x6\
  --engine=engine.argos\
  --batch-criteria=population_size.Log8\
  --n-runs=4\
  --expdef-template=~/my-template.argos\
  --project=fordyca

This invocation will cause SIERRA to create the following directory structure as
it runs::

  $HOME/exp
  |-- fordyca
      |-- CATEGORY.my_controller
          |-- SS.12x6
             |-- mytemplate-population_size.Log8
                 |-- exp-inputs
                    |-- c1-exp0
                        commands.txt
                        my-template_run0.argos
                        my-template_run1.argos
                        my-template_run2.argos
                        my-template_run3.argos
                    |-- c1-exp1
                        commands.txt
                        my-template_run0.argos
                        my-template_run1.argos
                        my-template_run2.argos
                        my-template_run3.argos
                    |-- c1-exp2
                        ...
                    |-- c1-exp3
                        ...
                 |-- exp-outputs
                    |-- c1-exp0
                        my-template_run0_output/
                        my-template_run1_output/
                        my-template_run2_output/
                        my-template_run3_output/
                    |-- c1-exp1
                        commands.txt
                        my-template_run0_output/
                        my-template_run1_output/
                        my-template_run2_output/
                        my-template_run3_output/
                    |-- c1-exp2
                        ...
                    |-- c1-exp3
                     ...


The meaning of each directory is discussed below.

- ``$HOME/exp`` - This is the root of the directory structure (``--sierra-root``),
  and is **NOT** deleted on subsequent runs.

- ``fordyca/`` - Each project gets their own directory, so you can disambiguate
  otherwise identical SIERRA invocations and don't overwrite the directories for
  a previously used project on subsequent runs.

- ``CATEGORY.my_controller/`` - Each controller gets their own directory in the
  project root, which is **NOT** deleted on subsequent runs.

- ``SS.12x6/`` - Each scenario gets their own directory inside an associated
  controller, whic his **NOT** deleted on subsequent runs.

- ``mytemplate-population_size.Log8/`` - The directory for the :term:`Batch
  Experiment` is named from a combination of the template input file used
  (``--expdef-template``) and the :term:`Batch Criteria` (``--batch-criteria``).

- ``exp-inputs`` - Root directory for :term:`Experimental<Experiment>` inputs;
  each experiment in the batch gets their own directory in here.

  - ``c1-exp0/`` - Within the input directory for each experiment in the batch
    (there are 4 such directories in this example), there will be an input file
    for each :term:`Experimental Run` in the experiment, as well as a
    ``commands.txt`` used by GNU parallel to run them all in parallel. The leaf
    of the ``--expdef-template``, sans extension, has the experimental run #
    appended to it (e.g. ``my-template_run0.argos`` is the input file for
    simulation 0).

      - ``commands.txt``

      - ``my-template_run0.argos``

      - ``my-template_run1.argos``

      - ``my-template_run2.argos``

      - ``my-template_run3.argos``

  - ``c1-exp1/``

    - ``my-template_run0.argos``

    - ``my-template_run1.argos``

    - ``my-template_run2.argos``

    - ``my-template_run3.argos``

  - ``c1-exp2/``

    - ``...``

- ``exp-outputs/`` - Root directory for experimental outputs; each experiment
  gets their own directory in here (just like for experiment inputs).

  - ``c1-exp0/`` - Within the output directory for each experiment in the batch
    (there are 3 such directories in this example), there will be a *directory*
    (rather than a file, as was the case for inputs) for each experimental run's
    output.

    - ``my-template_run0_output``

    - ``my-template_run1_output``

    - ``my-template_run2_output``

    - ``my-template_run3_output``

  - ``c1-exp1/``

    - ``my-template_run0_output``

    - ``my-template_run1_output``

    - ``my-template_run2_output``

    - ``my-template_run3_output``

  - ``c1-exp2/``

    - ``...``


  - ``exec/`` - Statistics about SIERRA runtime. Useful for capturing runtime of
    specific experiments to better plan/schedule time on HPC clusters, etc.

.. NOTE:: The above tree assumes that the :ref:`parallelism paradigm
          <tutorials/plugin/engine/config>` is ``per-exp``; if you select a
          different paradigm, then the structure will look slightly different.
