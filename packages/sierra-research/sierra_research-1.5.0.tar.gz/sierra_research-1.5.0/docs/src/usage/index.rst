Using SIERRA: All The Details
=============================

This page contains more in-depth documentation on how SIERRA works beyond the
minimum needed to get started, and assumes that you have either gotten SIERRA
working via :ref:`trial` or :ref:`startup`. Once you've done that, the
docs on this page provide a good way to understand how to get the most out of
SIERRA.
