SIERRA is a command line tool and plugin framework for:

- Automating scientific research, providing faculties for seamless experiment
  generation, execution, and results processing.

- Accelerating R&D cycles by allowing researchers/developers to focus on the
  “science” aspects: developing new things and designing experiments to test
  them, rather than the engineering aspects (writing scripts, configuring
  environments, etc).

- Maximizing the reproducibility of scientific research, particularly in AI; it
  is designed so that *no* copy-pasting of code/configuration between projects
  is needed.

It supports a wide range of execution engines/environments, experiment
input/output formats, and generatable products (e.g., graphs) via :ref:`plugins
<plugins>`. SIERRA supports mix-and-match between all plugin types, subject to
restrictions within the plugins themselves. This is THE most powerful feature of
SIERRA, and makes it very easy to run experiments on different hardware,
targeting different simulators, generating different outputs, etc., all with
little to no configuration changes by the user.

A short overview of the research automation SIERRA provides is here:
:ref:`usage/pipeline`. To get started, see :ref:`startup`.
