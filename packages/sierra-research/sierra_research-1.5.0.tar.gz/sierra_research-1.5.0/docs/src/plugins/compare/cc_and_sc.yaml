# Inter-controller comparison: For a set of controllers which have all been
# run in the same scenario.
inter-controller:
  # The filename (no path, extension) of the .csv within the collated .csv
  # output directory for each batch experiment which contains the information
  # to collate across controllers/scenarios.
  #
  # The src_stem must match the dest_stem from an inter-experiment line graph
  # in order to generate the comparison graph!
  #
  # Note that if you are using bivariate batch criteria + intra-scenario
  # comparison, you *may* have to append the interval # to the end of the
  # stem, because collated 2D CSV files form a temporal sequence over the
  # duration of the experiment. If you forget to do this, you will get a
  # warning and no graph will be generated, because SIERRA won't know which
  # 2D csv you want to us as source. Frequently you are interested in steady
  # state behavior, so putting 'n_intervals - 1' is desired.
  #
  # If the src_stem is from a CSV you generated outside of the SIERRA
  # core/via a hook, then this restriction does not apply.

    # The filename (no path, extent) of the .csv file within the
    # controller/scenario comparison directory in ``--sierra-root`` (outside
    # of the directories for each controller/scenario!) which should contain
    # the data collated from each batch experiment. I usually put a prefix
    # such as ``cc`` (controller comparison) to help distinguish these graphs
    # from the collated graphs in stage 4.

   # contains behavior under ideal conditions as the "base case" in the
