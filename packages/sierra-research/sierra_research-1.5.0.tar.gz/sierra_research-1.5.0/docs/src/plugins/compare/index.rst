==================
Comparison Plugins
==================

SIERRA supports a number of comparator plugins, all of which can be used to
compare products/deliverables generated in stage 4 in some way.

Before reading this page, take a look at :ref:`exp/design`, which details how
SIERRA experiments are architected at a high-level; these plugins tie in heavily
to that architecture. Specifically, see :ref:`here <exp/stage5-dataflow>` for
information about how output data flows/is transformed during stage5 processing.
