Experiment Definition Plugins
=============================

SIERRA is capable of reading ``--expdef-template`` from a number of formats.
Before diving into the details of the plugins, it is important to clarify
terminology around the different components in files passed to
``--expdef-template``:

- Attribute - The value part of a <key, value> pair within an
  ``--expdef-template`` which maps to a native primitive such as a bool, int, or
  string. Attributes *cannot* contain other attributes.

- Element - The value part of a <key, value> pair within an
  ``--expdef-template`` which maps to a sub-tree of configuration. Thus,
  elements can contain other elements, as well as *attributes* (depending on
  markup format).

- Tag - The key part of a <key, value> pair within an ``--expdef-template``
  which maps either to an *element* or an *attribute*.

The differences between these components is best illustrated with some simple
examples:

.. include:: examples.rst


With that understanding in place, the supported formats that come with SIERRA
are:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   xml.rst
   json.rst

Additional formats can be supported via :ref:`tutorials/plugin/expdef`.
