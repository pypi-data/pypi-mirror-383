                 Gazebo can group non-interacting entities into computational
                 "islands" and do the physics updates for those islands in
                 parallel each timestep (islands) are recomputed after each
                 timestep).  Gazebo can also parallelize the computation of
                 velocity/position updates with the computation of resolving
                 collisions (i.e., the timestep impulse results in one entity
                 "inside" another).  You can assign multiple threads to a pool
                 for cumulative use for these two parallelization methods
                 (threads will be allocated evenly between them).  The point at
                 which adding more threads will start to DECREASE performance
                 depends on the complexity of your world, the number and type of

                 From the Gazebo Parallel Physics Report, setting the pool size

                 good results, as long as you have more cores available than you
