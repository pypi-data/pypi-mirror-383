## üîç How Semantic Search Works

The server uses **sentence-transformers** to convert your memories into 384-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning:

### Example Searches

| Query | Finds Memories About |
|-------|---------------------|
| "authentication patterns" | JWT, OAuth, login systems, session management |
| "database performance" | SQL optimization, indexing, query tuning, caching |
| "React state management" | useState, Redux, Context API, state patterns |
| "API error handling" | HTTP status codes, retry logic, error responses |

### Similarity Scoring

- **0.9+ similarity**: Extremely relevant, almost exact matches
- **0.8-0.9**: Highly relevant, strong semantic similarity  
- **0.7-0.8**: Moderately relevant, good contextual match
- **0.6-0.7**: Somewhat relevant, might be useful
- **<0.6**: Low relevance, probably not helpful

## üìä Database Statistics

The `get_memory_stats` tool provides comprehensive insights:

```json
{
  "total_memories": 247,
  "memory_limit": 10000,
  "usage_percentage": 2.5,
  "categories": {
    "code-solution": 89,
    "bug-fix": 67,
    "learning": 45,
    "architecture": 23,
    "debugging": 18,
    "other": 5
  },
  "recent_week_count": 12,
  "database_size_mb": 15.7,
  "health_status": "Healthy"
}
```

### Statistics Fields Explained

- **total_memories**: Current number of memories stored in the database
- **memory_limit**: Maximum allowed memories (default: 10,000)
- **usage_percentage**: Database capacity usage (total_memories / memory_limit * 100)
- **categories**: Breakdown of memory count by category type
- **recent_week_count**: Number of memories created in the last 7 days
- **database_size_mb**: Physical size of the SQLite database file on disk
- **health_status**: Overall database health indicator based on usage and performance metrics

uv run main.py --working-dir ./test

# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.10+
```

#### Claude Desktop Not Connecting
1. Verify absolute paths in configuration
2. Check Claude Desktop logs: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
3. Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
4. Test server manually before configuring Claude

#### Memory Search Not Working
- Verify sentence-transformers model downloaded successfully
- Check database file permissions in memory/ directory
- Try broader search terms
- Review memory content for relevance

#### Performance Issues
- Run `get_memory_stats` to check database health
- Use `clear_old_memories` to clean up old entries
- Consider increasing hardware resources for embedding generation

### Debug Mode

Run the server manually to see detailed logs:

```bash
uv run main.py --working-dir ./debug-test
```

*Tested on MacBook Air M1 with sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2*

## üîß Advanced Implementation Details

### Database Indexes

The memory store uses 4 optimized indexes for performance:

1. **idx_category**: Speeds up category-based filtering and statistics
2. **idx_created_at**: Optimizes temporal queries and recent memory retrieval
3. **idx_content_hash**: Enables fast deduplication checks via SHA-256 hash lookups
4. **idx_access_count**: Improves cleanup algorithm efficiency by tracking usage patterns

### Deduplication System

Content deduplication uses SHA-256 hashing to prevent storing identical memories:
- Hash calculated on normalized content (trimmed, lowercased)
- Check performed before insertion
- Duplicate attempts return existing memory ID
- Reduces storage overhead and maintains data quality

### Access Tracking

Each memory tracks usage statistics for intelligent management:
- **access_count**: Number of times memory retrieved via search or direct access
- **last_accessed_at**: Timestamp of most recent access
- **created_at**: Original creation timestamp
- Used by cleanup algorithm to identify valuable vs. stale memories

### Cleanup Algorithm

Smart cleanup prioritizes memory retention based on multiple factors:
1. **Recency**: Newer memories are prioritized over older ones
2. **Access patterns**: Frequently accessed memories are protected
3. **Age threshold**: Configurable days_old parameter for hard cutoff
4. **Count limit**: Maintains max_memories cap by removing least valuable entries
5. **Scoring system**: Combines access_count and recency for retention decisions
