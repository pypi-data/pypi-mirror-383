# cuEquivariance

cuEquivariance is an NVIDIA Python library designed to facilitate the construction of high-performance geometric neural networks using segmented polynomials and triangular operations. cuEquivariance provides a comprehensive API for describing segmented polynomials made out of segmented tensor products and optimized CUDA kernels for their execution. Additionally, cuEquivariance offers bindings for both PyTorch and JAX, ensuring broad compatibility and ease of integration.

Equivariance is the mathematical formalization of the concept of "respecting symmetries." Robust physical models exhibit equivariance with respect to rotations and translations in three-dimensional space. Artificial intelligence models that incorporate equivariance are often more data-efficient.
