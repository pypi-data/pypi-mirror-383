# GDAL MCP v0.2.1 Release Notes

**Release Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Codename**: "Directional Awareness"

---

## Overview

Version 0.2.1 is a hotfix that sharpens the Phase 2B experience delivered in v0.2.0. It refines raster statistics helpers, introduces semantically distinct directional enums, and updates documentation to reflect the changes made since the Phase 2B work landed.

This release directly advances the vision outlined in [VISION.md](docs/VISION.md): creating AI systems that understand spatial problems, compose analytical workflows, and bridge the gap between domain expertise and technical implementation.

## What's New

Version 0.2.0 added three categories of resources that provide AI agents with the knowledge to make informed geospatial decisions. Version 0.2.1 builds on that by tightening the implementation details:

### 1. **Catalog Resources** - Workspace Awareness
Agents can now discover and inventory datasets in your workspace without explicit file paths. The catalog system automatically scans configured workspace directories, classifies files by type (raster/vector/other), and provides structured metadata for each dataset. Phase 2B introduced rich workspace summarisation (`catalog://workspace/summary/{dummy}`) and CRS-filtered views (`catalog://workspace/by-crs/{epsg}`) so agents can understand data coverage at a glance and target datasets that already align with a desired projection. Version 0.2.1 ensures `CatalogKind` is exported for downstream code and tests.

### 2. **Reference Resources** - Domain Knowledge
Built-in reference data for common geospatial decisions: CRS selection by region, resampling method guidance for different data types, compression options with use-case recommendations, and a geospatial terminology glossary.

### 3. **Metadata Resources** - Dataset Intelligence
Agents can inspect dataset characteristics before processing: format detection, driver information, spatial properties, statistical summaries, and band-level details. The band metadata resource (`metadata://{file}/bands/{dummy}`) exposes descriptions, nodata, colour interpretation, and optional quick statistics for every band. Version 0.2.1 refactors the raster statistics helper into smaller building blocks, exposes reproducible sampling constants, and records spatial extent using the new directional enums.

## How This Improves the Experience

### Reduced Interaction Overhead
With catalog resources, agents can discover available datasets independently, reducing the need for users to provide explicit file paths or enumerate available data. This streamlines workflows and enables more natural conversational interactions.

### Context-Aware Processing
Reference resources provide agents with domain knowledge about CRS selection, resampling methods, and compression options. Agents can now make informed technical decisions based on data characteristics and intended use cases, rather than relying on generic defaults.

### Enhanced Reasoning Capabilities
The combination of catalog discovery, metadata inspection, and reference data enables agents to reason about geospatial problems more effectively. For example, an agent can discover a DEM, recognize it as elevation data, select appropriate resampling for terrain analysis, and choose a suitable CRS for the region—all without explicit user guidance.

### Educational Support
The geospatial glossary and reference documentation help bridge knowledge gaps. Agents can explain terminology, recommend best practices, and provide context for technical decisions, making geospatial analysis more accessible to domain experts without deep GIS backgrounds.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Workspace-Aware Processing
```
User: "Reproject all DEMs in my workspace to UTM"
Agent: [Scans catalog for raster datasets]
       [Identifies elevation.tif and terrain.tif as DEMs]
       [Determines appropriate UTM zones from spatial bounds]
       [Selects cubic resampling for continuous elevation data]
       "Found 2 DEMs. Reprojecting elevation.tif to EPSG:32610 and terrain.tif to EPSG:32611..."
```

The agent discovers datasets, infers data types, and makes appropriate technical choices without requiring explicit instructions for each step.

### Example 2: Informed Technical Decisions
```
User: "Prepare this land cover raster for web display"
Agent: [Inspects metadata: categorical raster, 30m resolution]
       [Consults resampling reference: MODE for categorical data]
       [Consults CRS reference: EPSG:3857 for web display]
       [Consults compression reference: PNG for categorical preservation]
       "Converting to Web Mercator with MODE resampling and PNG compression to preserve land cover classes."
```

The agent combines metadata inspection with reference knowledge to make technically sound decisions aligned with data characteristics and use case requirements.

### Example 3: Educational Context
```
User: "Should I use bilinear or cubic resampling?"
Agent: [Consults resampling reference]
       "It depends on your data type and operation:
        - Bilinear: Fast, good for continuous data during upsampling
        - Cubic: Higher quality, better for continuous data but slower
        - For categorical data (land cover, classifications), use MODE or NEAREST instead
        What type of data are you working with?"
```

The agent provides contextual guidance based on reference data, helping users make informed decisions.

## Alignment with Vision

This release directly advances the goals outlined in [VISION.md](docs/VISION.md):

### From Command Executor to Reasoning Agent
Version 0.1.0 established reliable tool execution. Version 0.2.0 adds the knowledge infrastructure that enables **agentic reasoning**—agents can now understand context, consult domain knowledge, and make informed decisions rather than simply executing commands.

### Building Toward Autonomous Workflows
The catalog, metadata, and reference systems provide the foundation for multi-step workflow composition. Agents can now:
- Discover what data exists
- Understand data characteristics
- Select appropriate processing methods
- Explain technical decisions

These capabilities are prerequisites for the autonomous workflow planning targeted in Phase 3.

### Bridging Domain Expertise and Technical Implementation
The reference resources and glossary help bridge the gap between geospatial domain knowledge and technical GIS implementation. Domain experts can work with agents that understand both the spatial problem and the technical solution space.

## What's Next

Version 0.2.0 completes **Phase 2A** (Resources) and sets the stage for **Phase 2B** (Prompts) and **Phase 3** (Multi-step Workflows):

### Upcoming in v0.3.0
- **Prompt Resources**: Guided reasoning templates for common geospatial analysis patterns
- **Workflow Composition**: Multi-step analysis planning and execution
- **State Management**: Session context and intermediate result handling
- **Enhanced Catalog**: Spatial indexing and metadata caching for performance

### Long-term Direction
The vision is to enable domain experts to express geospatial problems in natural language and receive complete, correct analytical workflows. Version 0.2.0 provides the knowledge infrastructure that makes this possible—agents now have access to the domain knowledge, workspace awareness, and reference data needed to reason about spatial problems effectively.
