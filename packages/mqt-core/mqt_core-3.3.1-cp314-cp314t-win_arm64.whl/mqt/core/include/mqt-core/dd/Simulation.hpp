 * @brief Simulate a purely-quantum @ref qc::QuantumComputation on a given input
 * state using decision diagrams.
 *
 * @details This method classically simulates the quantum computation @p qc on
 * the input state @p in by sequentially applying the operations in the circuit
 * to the initial state via decision diagram multiplication.
 *
 * This simple simulation method can only handle circuits that do not contain
 * any classical control operations or measurements.
 * Its main purpose is to construct a representation of the statevector after
 * simulating the quantum computation for the given input state.
 * For more elaborate simulation methods that can handle classical control and
 * mid-circuit measurements, see @ref sample(const QuantumComputation&,
 * std::size_t, std::size_t).
 *
 * @param qc The quantum computation to simulate
 * @param in The input state to simulate. Represented as a vector DD.
 * @param dd The DD package to use for the simulation
 * @return A vector DD representing the output state of the simulation

/**
 * @brief Sample from the output distribution of a quantum computation
 *
 * @details This method classically simulates the quantum computation @p qc
 * starting from the all-zero state and samples @p shots times from the output
 * distribution.
 * The seed for the random number generator can be set using @p seed.
 *
 * For a circuit without mid-circuit measurements, this function will construct
 * a representation of the final statevector similar to @ref simulate and then
 * repeatedly sample from the resulting decision diagram, without actually
 * collapsing the state. For a fixed number of qubits, each sample can be drawn
 * in constant time, which is a significant of the decision diagram structure.
 *
 * For a circuit with mid-circuit measurements, this function will separately
 * execute the circuit for each sample, probabilistically collapsing the state
 * after each measurement.
 *
 * @param qc The quantum computation to simulate
 * @param shots The number of shots to sample
 * @param seed The seed for the random number generator
 * @return A histogram of the measurement results
