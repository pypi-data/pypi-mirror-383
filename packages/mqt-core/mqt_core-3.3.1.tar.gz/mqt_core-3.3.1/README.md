# MQT Core - The Backbone of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)

MQT Core is an open-source C++20 and Python library for quantum computing that forms the backbone of the quantum software tools developed as part of the [_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io).

  </a>
</p>

## Key Features

- Fully fledged intermediate representation (IR) for quantum computations.
- A state-of-the-art decision diagram (DD) package for quantum computing.
- A dedicated ZX-diagram package for working with the ZX-calculus.
- A QIR runtime based on the decision diagram package.

## Contributors and Supporters

The _[Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)](https://mqt.readthedocs.io)_ is developed by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and supported by the [Munich Quantum Software Company (MQSC)](https://munichquantum.software).
Among others, it is part of the [Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de/research/research-areas/mqss) ecosystem, which is being developed as part of the [Munich Quantum Valley (MQV)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de) initiative.

The MQT will remain free, open-source, and permissively licensedâ€”now and in the future.
We are firmly committed to keeping it open and actively maintained for the quantum computing community.

To support this endeavor, please consider:

- Starring and sharing our repositories: https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit
- Contributing code, documentation, tests, or examples via issues and pull requests
- Citing the MQT in your publications (see [Cite This](#cite-this))
- Citing our research in your publications (see [References](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/core/en/latest/references.html))
- Using the MQT in research and teaching, and sharing feedback and use cases
- Sponsoring us on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/munich-quantum-toolkit

## Getting Started

`mqt.core` is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.core/).

```console
(.venv) $ pip install mqt.core
```

The following code gives an example on the usage:

```python3
from mqt.core import QuantumComputation

qc = QuantumComputation(2, 2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure(range(2), range(2))

print(qc)
```

**Detailed documentation and examples are available at [ReadTheDocs](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/core).**

## System Requirements

Building the project requires a C++ compiler with support for C++20 and CMake 3.24 or newer.
For details on how to build the project, please refer to the [documentation](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/core).
Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux, macOS, and Windows using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).
MQT Core is compatible with all [officially supported Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).

The project relies on some external dependencies:

- [boost/multiprecision](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision): A library for multiprecision arithmetic (used in the ZX package).
- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json): A JSON library for modern C++.
- [pybind/pybind11_json](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11_json): A library for using `nlohmann::json` with `pybind11` (only used for creating the Python bindings).
- [google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest): A testing framework for C++ (only used in tests).

CMake will automatically look for installed versions of these libraries. If it does not find them, they will be fetched automatically at configure time via the [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) module (check out the documentation for more information on how to customize this behavior).

It is recommended (although not required) to have [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org) installed for visualization purposes.

If you want to use the ZX library, it is recommended (although not strictly necessary) to have [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) installed in your system.
