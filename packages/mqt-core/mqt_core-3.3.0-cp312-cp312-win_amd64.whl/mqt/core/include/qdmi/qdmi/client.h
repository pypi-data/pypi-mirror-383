 *  - Create a job with @ref QDMI_device_create_job.
 *  - Set parameters for the job with @ref QDMI_job_set_parameter.
 *  - Submit the job to the device with @ref QDMI_job_submit.
 *  - Check the status of the job with @ref QDMI_job_check.
 *  - Wait for the job to finish with @ref QDMI_job_wait.
 *  - Retrieve the results of the job with @ref QDMI_job_get_results.
 *  - Free the job with @ref QDMI_job_free when it is no longer used.
