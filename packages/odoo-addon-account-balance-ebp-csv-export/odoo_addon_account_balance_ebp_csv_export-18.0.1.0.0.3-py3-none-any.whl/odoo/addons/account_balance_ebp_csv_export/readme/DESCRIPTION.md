One of the possible usage scenario of this module is to export the trial balance to software dedicated to the [liasse fiscale](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liasse_fiscale) (French fiscal declaration) that accept balance files from the EBP accounting software. This file has been successfully tested with the following software:

* [Teledec](https://www.teledec.fr/), which is a SaaS solution for the *liasse fiscale* with support for EDI transmission. With Teledec, we recommend to use an EBP balance in XLSX format.

* [Sage Etats Comptables et Fiscaux](https://www.sage.com/fr-fr/produits/sage-frp-etats-comptables-et-fiscaux/), which is a Windows software to compute, edit and transmit via EDI the *liasse fiscale* and other fiscal declarations. It can import the CSV balance generated by this module if you select *EBP WIN* as import filter. WARNING: it has not yet be re-tested with Sage Etats Comptables et Fiscaux following the switch from the aeroo-based version to the aeroo-free version (re-testing is needed because the CSV is not formatted exactly the same way).
