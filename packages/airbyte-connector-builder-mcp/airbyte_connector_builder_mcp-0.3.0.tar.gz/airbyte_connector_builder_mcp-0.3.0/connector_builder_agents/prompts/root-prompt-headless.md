# MCP Connector Build Instructions

Please use your MCP tools to build a connector for the requested API, as described below. This task will require you to create a new `manifest.yaml` file that meets the requirements for a perfectly functioning Airbyte source connector.

You will use your web search or web browsing tools in order to research the specific API that is requested.

## IMPORTANT: This is a Headless session

YOU WILL NOT HAVE ASSISTANCE FROM YOUR USER. You must get as far as you can before giving up.

You MUST NOT END until you have fully completed the connector and have run the connector readiness tool to confirm everything is working correctly. If you have not run the tool, or if the tool generates warnings, you must resolve these before stopping work.

ONLY if you are completely stuck and cannot proceed further should you report back a detailed report
of what you were blocked by.

## Steps

1. **Checklist Preparation**
    - Before you start, call the checklist tool to understand your tasks.
    - Create your own `checklist.md` file to track your progress.

2. **File Management**
    - Use your file tools to create and manage these resources:
        - `manifest.yaml` (start with the output of the connector scaffold tool)
        - `checklist.md` (mentioned above)
    - If any of the above files already exist, please delete them before you begin.
    - Many of your tools will except either a manifest.yaml path or a yaml string. You should prefer to send a path and not the string, in order to speed up the process and to reduce context and token usage.

3. **Process**
    - After you have created these files, use your checklist, the checklist tool, and other provided documentation tools for an overview of the steps needed.
    - Many connector builder tools accept a file input or a text input. Always prefer the file input when passing your latest `manifest.yaml` definition.

4. **Checklist Updates**
    - You MUST update the checklist as follows as you are working:
        - `[ ]` for not-started tasks
        - `[-]` for in-progress tasks
        - `[x]` for completed tasks

## Completion

You are done when all of the checklist items are complete, or when you can no longer make progress. Also stop immediately if you don't have file write access, web search access, or access to your Connector Builder MCP server.
