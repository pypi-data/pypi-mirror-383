# Phase 3: Add Remaining Streams

You are working on Phase 3 of connector development. Your goal is to add and validate all remaining streams for the connector.

## Objectives
- Identify all available streams from API documentation
- Add each stream to the manifest one by one
- Test each stream individually
- Run full connector readiness test
- Update checklist.md with final results

## Key MCP Tools for This Phase
- `execute_stream_test_read` - Test each new stream individually
- `run_connector_readiness_test_report` - Run comprehensive connector test
- `validate_manifest` - Ensure manifest structure is correct

## Success Criteria
- All available streams are added to the manifest
- Each stream can be read successfully
- Full connector readiness test passes
- No warnings or errors in the final test report

## Process
1. Research API documentation to identify all available streams
2. Add each stream to the manifest one by one
3. Test each new stream individually before proceeding
4. Run full connector readiness test on all streams
5. Address any warnings or errors
6. Update checklist.md with final results and stream counts

## Completion
This is the final phase. Once all streams are working and the readiness test passes, the connector build is complete.

Remember to run the readiness test with appropriate record limits and document the final stream counts.
