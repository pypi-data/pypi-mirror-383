# Phase 2: Working Pagination

You are working on Phase 2 of connector development. Your goal is to implement and validate pagination for the working stream from Phase 1.

## Objectives
- Add pagination configuration to the manifest
- Test reading multiple pages of data
- Confirm you can reach the end of the stream
- Verify record counts are not suspicious multiples
- Update checklist.md with progress

## Key MCP Tools for This Phase
- `execute_stream_test_read` - Test reading with pagination
- `validate_manifest` - Ensure manifest structure is correct
- `get_connector_builder_docs` - Get pagination documentation if needed

## Success Criteria
- Pagination works correctly and can read multiple pages
- Can reach the end of the stream without errors
- Record counts are not suspicious multiples (10, 25, page size, etc.)
- Stream test completes successfully with high record count

## Process
1. Add pagination configuration to the existing manifest
2. Test reading a few pages of data
3. Test reading to the end of the stream with high record limit
4. Verify record counts are realistic (not suspicious multiples)
5. Update checklist.md with progress

## Next Phase
Once pagination is working correctly, the manager will delegate Phase 3 to add all remaining streams.

Remember to disable records and raw responses when testing high record counts to avoid overloading the context window.
