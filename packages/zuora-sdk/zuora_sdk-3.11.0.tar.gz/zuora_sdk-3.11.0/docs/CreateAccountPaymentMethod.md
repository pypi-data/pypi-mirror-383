# CreateAccountPaymentMethod

Container for information on payment methods to associate with this account. To associate a credit card payment method when creating an account, Zuora recommends that you use this field instead of the `creditCard` field.   Note that you can not use this field together with `creditCard` or `hpmCreditCardPaymentMethodId` to associate a payment method to an account.
