List custom exchange rates by currency

This feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/).   This reference describes how to query custom foreign exchange rates from Zuora. You can use this API method to query exchange rates only if you use a custom exchange rate provider and upload rates with the Import Foreign Exchange Rates mass action.  

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python
import zuora_sdk
from zuora_sdk.models.get_custom_exchange_rates_type import GetCustomExchangeRatesType
from zuora_sdk.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: bearerAuth
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with zuora_sdk.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = zuora_sdk.CustomExchangeRatesApi(api_client)
    currency = 'currency_example' # str | The target base currency of the tenant. The exchange rates in the response are calculated in relation to the target currency.  The value must be a three-letter currency code, for example, USD.  
    start_date = 'start_date_example' # str | Start date of the date range for which you want to get exchange rates.  The date must be in yyyy-mm-dd format, for example, 2016-01-15. The start date cannot be later than the end date.
    end_date = 'end_date_example' # str | End date of the date range for which you want to get exchange rates.  The date must be in yyyy-mm-dd format, for example, 2016-01-16. The end date can be a maximum of 90 days after the start date.
    accept_encoding = 'accept_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  (optional)
    content_encoding = 'content_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  (optional)
    authorization = 'authorization_example' # str | The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  (optional)
    zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)
    zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)
    zuora_version = '2024-05-20' # str | The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   (optional) (default to '2024-05-20')
    zuora_org_ids = 'zuora_org_ids_example' # str | Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.  (optional)

    try:
        # List custom exchange rates by currency
        api_response = api_instance.get_custom_exchange_rates(currency, start_date, end_date, accept_encoding=accept_encoding, content_encoding=content_encoding, authorization=authorization, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids, zuora_version=zuora_version, zuora_org_ids=zuora_org_ids)
        print("The response of CustomExchangeRatesApi->get_custom_exchange_rates:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling CustomExchangeRatesApi->get_custom_exchange_rates: %s\n" % e)
```
