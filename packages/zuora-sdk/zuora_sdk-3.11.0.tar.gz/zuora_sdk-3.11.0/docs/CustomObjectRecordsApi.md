# **get_all_records_for_custom_object_type**
> QueryCustomObjectRecordsResponse get_all_records_for_custom_object_type(object, accept_encoding=accept_encoding, content_encoding=content_encoding, zuora_track_id=zuora_track_id, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids, authorization=authorization, zuora_version=zuora_version, q=q, ids=ids, page=page, page_size=page_size, cursor=cursor, zuora_org_ids=zuora_org_ids)

List records for a custom object

Lists all object records of the given type. You can also use the `q` query parameter to filter the output records.   ### Custom Objects read consistency  Custom Objects support eventually consistency. When you read custom object records, the response might not reflect the result of a recently completed operation and might include some stale data. The operations include creating, updating, and deleting custom object records.  If you repeat your read request after a short time, the response should return the latest data.  For example, if you create five records and perform a query that these five records satisfy the query conditions, there might be a delay before these records can be returned in the query result.

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **object** | **str**| Specifies the custom object&#39;s API name as object. It is case-sensitive. | 
 **id** | **str**| Id identifier in uuid form | 
 **accept_encoding** | **str**| Include the &#x60;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a &#x60;Content-Encoding&#x60; header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  | [optional] 
 **content_encoding** | **str**| Include the &#x60;Content-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  | [optional] 
 **zuora_track_id** | **str**| A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (&#x60;:&#x60;), semicolon (&#x60;;&#x60;), double quote (&#x60;\&quot;&#x60;), and quote (&#x60;&#39;&#x60;).  | [optional] 
 **zuora_entity_ids** | **str**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] 
 **authorization** | **str**| The value is in the &#x60;Bearer {token}&#x60; format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  | [optional] 
 **zuora_version** | **str**| The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   | [optional] [default to &#39;2024-05-20&#39;]
 **zuora_org_ids** | **str**| Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user&#39;s accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user&#39;s accessible orgs.  | [optional]

Partially update a custom object record

Updates one or many fields of a custom object record. Patch update uses JSON Merge Patch as specified in [RFC 7386](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386). n### Limitations   * The storage of empty strings in records is not supported. * Null values must be formatted as the following example:    ```   {     \"records\": [       {         \"fieldName__c\": null       }     ]   }   ``` 

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (bearerAuth):

Update or delete custom object records

Makes a batch update or delete of custom object records. ### Limitations   This call has the following limitations: * The maximum number of records that you can update by one call is 1,000. * The maximum number of records that you can delete by one call is 1,000. * The storage of empty strings in records is not supported. * Null values must be formatted as the following example:    ```   {       \"action\": {           \"type\": \"update\",           \"records\": {               \"64edb2a5-2796-4e95-9559-846f8636a01b\": {                   \"fieldName__c\": null             }           }       }   }   ``` 

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python
import zuora_sdk
from zuora_sdk.models.custom_object_record_batch_request import CustomObjectRecordBatchRequest
from zuora_sdk.models.custom_object_records_batch_update_partial_success_response import CustomObjectRecordsBatchUpdatePartialSuccessResponse
from zuora_sdk.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.zuora.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.zuora.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: bearerAuth
configuration = zuora_sdk.Configuration(

    custom_object_record_batch_request = zuora_sdk.CustomObjectRecordBatchRequest() # CustomObjectRecordBatchRequest | 
    idempotency_key = 'idempotency_key_example' # str | Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.   (optional)
    accept_encoding = 'accept_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  (optional)
    content_encoding = 'content_encoding_example' # str | Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  (optional)
    zuora_track_id = 'zuora_track_id_example' # str | A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).  (optional)
    zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)
    authorization = 'authorization_example' # str | The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  (optional)
    zuora_version = '2024-05-20' # str | The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   (optional) (default to '2024-05-20')
    zuora_org_ids = 'zuora_org_ids_example' # str | Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.  (optional)
