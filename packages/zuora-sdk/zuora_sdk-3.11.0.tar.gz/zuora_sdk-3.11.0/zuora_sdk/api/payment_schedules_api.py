        """Retry failed payment schedule items

        Retries failed payment schedule items. The payment method and payment gateway of the failed payment can be updated to new values before the retry.  Note that you can retry a payment schedule item only when the payment schedule item is either in the `Error` or `Pending` status.  **Note:** - The Payment Schedules feature is in the **Early Adopter** phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. To manage and access this feature through the self-service interface, see [Manage Features](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Payments/Payments_Settings/Manage_Features) in the Knowledge Center. - This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled.

With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.

        :param accept_encoding: Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.

        Updates a payment schedule. For custom payment schedules, only the custom fields on the payment schedules can be udpated. Use the [Update a payment schedule item](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Put_PaymentScheduleItem/) operation to update payment schedule items of custom payment schedule.  Note the following rules for the `periodStartDate`, `period`, and `occurrences`:  - If `periodStartDate` is specified, all pending payment schedule items will be rescheduled using this new `periodStartDate`. If `period` is changed, we recommend passing in `periodStartDate`. Otherwise, the system would use the original start date if there is no processed or canceled items, or the last processed or canceled '`scheduleDate` + 1 `period`' as the new `periodStartDate`. - If only `occurrences` is updated, the new item will start with the last processed or canceled '`scheduleDate` + 1 `period`'.  **Note:** - The Payment Schedules feature is in the **Early Adopter** phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. To manage and access this feature through the self-service interface, see [Manage Features](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Payments/Payments_Settings/Manage_Features) in the Knowledge Center. - This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled.

        Preview the result of a payment schedule update. This operation only provides a preview. No changes will be made to the database. For custom payment schedules, only the custom fields on the payment schedules can be udpated. Use the [Update a payment schedule item](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/tag/Put_PaymentScheduleItem) operation to update payment schedule items of custom payment schedule.  Note the following rules for the `periodStartDate`, `period`, and `occurrences`:  - If `periodStartDate` is specified, all pending payment schedule items will be rescheduled using this new `periodStartDate`. If `period` is changed, we recommend passing in `periodStartDate`. Otherwise, the system would use the original start date if there is no processed or canceled items, or the last processed or canceled '`scheduleDate` + 1 `period`' as the new `periodStartDate`. - If only `occurrences` is updated, the new item will start with the last processed or canceled '`scheduleDate` + 1 `period`'.  **Note:** - The Payment Schedules feature is in the **Early Adopter** phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. To manage and access this feature through the self-service interface, see [Manage Features](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Payments/Payments_Settings/Manage_Features) in the Knowledge Center.
