The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.   Deletes a payment. Only payments with the Cancelled status can be deleted.   If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, overpayments applied to credit balance cannot be deleted. 

        :param payment_key: The unique ID or number of an unapplied payment. For example, `8a8082e65b27f6c3015b89e4344c16b1`, or `P-00000001`. (required)
        :type payment_key: str
        :param accept_encoding: Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 
        :type accept_encoding: str
        :param content_encoding: Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.

        :type authorization: str
        :param zuora_track_id: A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.

If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 
        :type zuora_entity_ids: str

If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

        :param payment_key: The unique ID or number of an unapplied payment. For example, `8a8082e65b27f6c3015b89e4344c16b1`, or `P-00000001`. (required)
        :type payment_key: str
        :param accept_encoding: Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 
        :type accept_encoding: str
        :param content_encoding: Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 
        :type content_encoding: str
        :param authorization: The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 
        :type authorization: str
        :param zuora_track_id: A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 
        :type zuora_track_id: str
        :param zuora_entity_ids: An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 
        :type zuora_entity_ids: str
        :param zuora_version: The minor version of the Zuora REST API.  
        :type zuora_version: str
        :param zuora_org_ids: Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 
        :type zuora_org_ids: str
        :param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                                 number provided, it will be total request
                                 timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                                 (connection, read) timeouts.
        :type _request_timeout: int, tuple(int, int), optional
        :param _request_auth: set to override the auth_settings for an a single
                              request; this effectively ignores the
                              authentication in the spec for a single request.
        :type _request_auth: dict, optional
        :param _content_type: force content-type for the request.
        :type _content_type: str, Optional
        :param _headers: set to override the headers for a single
                         request; this effectively ignores the headers
                         in the spec for a single request.
        :type _headers: dict, optional

                            request; this effectively ignores the host_index
                            in the spec for a single request.

Retrieves the information about a specific payment part item. A payment part item is a single line item in a payment part. A payment part can consist of several different types of items. 

        :param part_id: The unique ID of a specific payment part. You can get the payment part ID from the response of [List all parts of a payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Get_PaymentParts). (required)

The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.   Retrieves the information about all payments from all your customer accounts.  ### Filtering  You can use query parameters to restrict the data returned in the response. Each query parameter corresponds to one field in the response body.  If the value of a filterable field is string, you can set the corresponding query parameter to `null` when filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being `null`.

        :param sort: This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.  A sortable field uses the following form:   *operator* *field_name*  You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*    *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.    - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.   - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.  By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by payment number.  *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:    - number   - accountId   - amount   - appliedAmount   - unappliedAmount   - refundAmount   - creditBalanceAmount   - effectiveDate   - createdDate   - createdById   - updatedDate   - updatedById    Examples:  - /v1/payments?sort=+number  - /v1/payments?status=Processed&sort=-number,+amount

The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.   Unapplies an applied payment from invoices and debit memos.  When you unapply a payment, the total number of invoice items and debit memo items that the payment will unapply from must be less than or equal to 15,000.  If the limit is hit, you can follow the instructions: - If you want to unapply one payment without specifying invoices or debit memos, you have to specify the invoices or debit memos in the request. - If you want to unapply one payment from multiple specified invoices or debit memos, decrease the number of invoices or debit memos in the request. - If you want to unapply one payment from a single invoice or debit memo with a large volume of items, you have to specify invoice items in the request. The maximum number of invoice items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.
