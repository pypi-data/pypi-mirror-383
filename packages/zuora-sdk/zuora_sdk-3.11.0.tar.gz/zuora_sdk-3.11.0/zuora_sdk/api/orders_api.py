The limit of orders allowed on a subscription is 1000.  The limit of order line items allowed in an order is 100.  Zuora has the following limits on the Orders synchronous API to prevent performance degradation:  * Up to 50 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrder) operation call. * Up to 50 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrder) operation call. * Up to 50 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrder) operation call.  If you have an Order that exceeds any limits of the above, Zuora recommends you use the following asynchronous API operations: * [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_CreateOrderAsynchronously) * [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) nZuora has the following limits on the Orders asynchronous API operations to prevent performance degradation: * Up to 300 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. * Up to 300 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. * Up to 300 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.   **Note:** When you are to suspend a subcription (via the `suspend` order action), if in the same \"Create an order\" call you are to perform other subsequent order actions on the supscription to suspend, you must first resume the subscription (via a `resume` order action).   **Note:** When using this operation to create an account, create a subscription, run billing, and collect payment in a single call, if any error occurs during the call, such as a payment processing failure and a tax engine failure, then all the other steps will be rolled back. This means that the invoice will not be generated, the subscription will not be created, and the account will not be created.

The limit of orders allowed on a subscription is 1000.  The limit of order line items allowed in an order is 100.  Zuora has the following limits on the Orders synchronous API to prevent performance degradation:  * Up to 50 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrder) operation call. * Up to 50 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrder) operation call. * Up to 50 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrder) operation call.  If you have an Order that exceeds any limits of the above, Zuora recommends you use the following asynchronous API operations: * [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_CreateOrderAsynchronously) * [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) nZuora has the following limits on the Orders asynchronous API operations to prevent performance degradation: * Up to 300 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. * Up to 300 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. * Up to 300 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.   **Note:** When you are to suspend a subcription (via the `suspend` order action), if in the same \"Create an order\" call you are to perform other subsequent order actions on the supscription to suspend, you must first resume the subscription (via a `resume` order action).   **Note:** When using this operation to create an account, create a subscription, run billing, and collect payment in a single call, if any error occurs during the call, such as a payment processing failure and a tax engine failure, then all the other steps will be rolled back. This means that the invoice will not be generated, the subscription will not be created, and the account will not be created.

        :param idempotency_key: Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  
        :type idempotency_key: str
        :param accept_encoding: Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 
        :type accept_encoding: str

If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

As of Zuora Billing Release 313 (November 2021), new customers who onboard on [Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders) will have the [Order Line Items](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items) feature enabled by default.        In the case where a normal \"Create an order\" operation call will time out, use this operation instead to create an order asynchronously. A job will be creating the order in the back end; the job ID will be returned for tracking the job status and result.   Note that this operation doesn't support auto-refund and invoice write-off during subscription cancellation. Use the \"Create an order\" operation instead.  The limit of orders allowed on a subscription is 1000.  The limit of order line items allowed in an order is 100.  Zuora has the following limits on the Orders synchronous API to prevent performance degradation:  * Up to 50 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrder) operation call. * Up to 50 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrder) operation call. * Up to 50 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrder) operation call.  If you have an Order that exceeds any limits of the above, Zuora recommends you use the following asynchronous API operations: * [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_CreateOrderAsynchronously) * [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) nZuora has the following limits on the Orders asynchronous API operations to prevent performance degradation: * Up to 300 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. * Up to 300 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. * Up to 300 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Post_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.

        :param job_id: UUID of the asynchronous job created by an asynchronous API operation. (required)
        :type job_id: str
        :param accept_encoding: Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 
        :type accept_encoding: str
        :param content_encoding: Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 
        :type content_encoding: str
        :param authorization: The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 
        :type authorization: str
        :param zuora_track_id: A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 
        :type zuora_track_id: str
        :param zuora_version: The minor version of the Zuora REST API.  
        :type zuora_version: str
        :param zuora_org_ids: Comma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 
        :type zuora_org_ids: str
        :param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                                 number provided, it will be total request
                                 timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                                 (connection, read) timeouts.
        :type _request_timeout: int, tuple(int, int), optional
        :param _request_auth: set to override the auth_settings for an a single
                              request; this effectively ignores the
                              authentication in the spec for a single request.
        :type _request_auth: dict, optional
        :param _content_type: force content-type for the request.
        :type _content_type: str, Optional
        :param _headers: set to override the headers for a single
                         request; this effectively ignores the headers
                         in the spec for a single request.
        :type _headers: dict, optional
        :param _host_index: set to override the host_index for a single
                            request; this effectively ignores the host_index
                            in the spec for a single request.
        :type _host_index: int, optional
        :return: Returns the result object.

If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.

        :param zuora_track_id: A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.

If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.

If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.
