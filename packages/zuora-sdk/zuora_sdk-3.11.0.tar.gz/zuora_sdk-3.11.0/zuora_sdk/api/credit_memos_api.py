See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.  Zero-amount memo items are supported in the following scenarios: - If you want to correct taxation items only for an invoice, you can set the memo item amount to zero, but the taxation item amount to non-zero. - If you want to correct personal data in an invoice, you can set the memo item amount to zero to create a zero-amount credit memo from an invoice.

With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  
        :type idempotency_key: str
        :param accept_encoding: Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 
        :type accept_encoding: str

        **Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.    Updates the basic and finance information about multiple credit memos. You can update a maximum of 50 credit memos in one single request.      The credit memos that are updated are each in separate database transactions. If the update of one credit memo fails, other credit memos can still be updated successfully.       Currently, Zuora supports updating tax-exclusive memo items, but does not support updating tax-inclusive memo items.    If the amount of a memo item is updated, the tax will be recalculated in the following conditions:   - The memo is created from a product rate plan charge and you use Avalara to calculate the tax.   - The memo is created from an invoice and you use Avalara or Zuora Tax to calculate the tax.    You can update credit memos only if you have the user permission.

        **Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.    Updates the basic and finance information about multiple credit memos. You can update a maximum of 50 credit memos in one single request.      The credit memos that are updated are each in separate database transactions. If the update of one credit memo fails, other credit memos can still be updated successfully.       Currently, Zuora supports updating tax-exclusive memo items, but does not support updating tax-inclusive memo items.    If the amount of a memo item is updated, the tax will be recalculated in the following conditions:   - The memo is created from a product rate plan charge and you use Avalara to calculate the tax.   - The memo is created from an invoice and you use Avalara or Zuora Tax to calculate the tax.    You can update credit memos only if you have the user permission. See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.

A sortable field uses the following form:   *operator* *field_name*  You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*    *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.    - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.   - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.  By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by credit memo number.  *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:    - accountId   - amount   - appliedAmount   - createdById   - createdDate   - creditMemoDate   - number   - referredInvoiceId   - refundAmount   - status   - targetDate   - taxAmount   - totalTaxExemptAmount   - transferredToAccounting   - unappliedAmount   - updatedDate     Examples:  - /v1/credit-memos?sort=+number  - /v1/credit-memos?status=Processed&sort=-number,+amount

        **Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.   Uploads an externally generated PDF file for a credit memo that is in Draft or Posted status.  To use this operation, you must enable the Modify Modify Credit Memo permission. See [Billing Permissions](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Tenant_Management/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.  This operation has the following restrictions: - Only the PDF file format is supported. - The maximum size of the PDF file to upload is 4 MB. - A maximum of 50 PDF files can be uploaded for one credit memo. 

        :param credit_memo_key: The ID or number of the credit memo that you want to upload a PDF file for. For example, 402890555a7e9791015a879f064a0054 or CM00000001. (required)
        :type credit_memo_key: str
        :param idempotency_key: Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  
        :type idempotency_key: str
        :param accept_encoding: Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 
        :type accept_encoding: str

If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in.

        :type zuora_entity_ids: str
        :param zuora_track_id: A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).

If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header. The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.
