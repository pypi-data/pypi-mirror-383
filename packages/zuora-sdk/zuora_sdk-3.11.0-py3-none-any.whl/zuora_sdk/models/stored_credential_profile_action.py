    Specifies how Zuora activates the stored credential profile. Only applicable if you set the `status` field to `Active`.  - `Activate` (default) - Use this value if you are creating the stored credential profile after receiving the customer's consent.    Zuora will create the stored credential profile then send a cardholder-initiated transaction (CIT) to the payment gateway to validate the stored credential profile. If the CIT succeeds, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Active`. If the CIT does not succeed, Zuora will not create a stored credential profile.      If the payment gateway does not support the stored credential transaction framework, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Agreed`.   - `Persist` - Use this value if the stored credential profile represents a stored credential profile in an external system. The status of the payment method's stored credential profile will be `Active`.
