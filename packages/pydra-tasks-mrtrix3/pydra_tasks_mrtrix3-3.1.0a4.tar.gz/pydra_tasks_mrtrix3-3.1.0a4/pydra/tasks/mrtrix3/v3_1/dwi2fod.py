        Example usages
        --------------


        Perform single-shell single-tissue CSD:

        `$ dwi2fod csd dwi.mif response_wm.txt wmfod.mif`

        This algorithm is designed for single-shell data and only uses a single b-value. The response function text file provided should only contain a a single row, corresponding to the b-value used for CSD.


        Perform multi-shell multi-tissue CSD:

        `$ dwi2fod msmt_csd dwi.mif response_wm.txt wmfod.mif response_gm.txt gm.mif response_csf.txt csf.mif`

        This example is the most common use case of multi-tissue CSD, estimating a white matter FOD, and grey matter and CSF compartments. This algorithm requires at least three unique b-values to estimate three tissue compartments. Each response function text file should have a number of rows equal to the number of b-values used. If only two unique b-values are available, it's also possible to estimate only two tissue compartments, e.g., white matter and CSF.
