    """This command will only compute per-voxel operations. Use 'mrmath' to compute
    summary statistics across images or along image axes.

        This command uses a stack-based syntax, with operators (specified using options)
        operating on the top-most entries (i.e. images or values) in the stack. Operands
        (values or images) are pushed onto the stack in the order they appear
        (as arguments) on the command-line, and operators (specified as options)
        operate on and consume the top-most entries in the stack, and push their
        output as a new entry on the stack.

        As an additional feature, this command will allow images with different
        dimensions to be processed, provided they satisfy the following conditions:
        for each axis, the dimensions match if they are the same size, or one of them
        has size one. In the latter case, the entire image will be replicated along that
        axis. This allows for example a 4D image of size [ X Y Z N ] to be added to a
        3D image of size [ X Y Z ], as if it consisted of N copies of the 3D image along
        the 4th axis (the missing dimension is assumed to have size 1). Another example
        would a single-voxel 4D image of size [ 1 1 1 N ], multiplied by a 3D image of
        size [ X Y Z ], which would allow the creation of a 4D image where each volume
        consists of the 3D image scaled by the corresponding value for that volume in
        the single-voxel image.


        Example usages
        --------------


        Double the value stored in every voxel:

            `$ mrcalc a.mif 2 -mult r.mif`

            This performs the operation: r = 2*a  for every voxel a,r in images a.mif
            and r.mif respectively.


        A more complex example:

            `$ mrcalc a.mif -neg b.mif -div -exp 9.3 -mult r.mif`

            This performs the operation: r = 9.3*exp(-a/b)


        Another complex example:

            `$ mrcalc a.mif b.mif -add c.mif d.mif -mult 4.2 -add -div r.mif`

            This performs: r = (a+b)/(c*d+4.2).


        Rescale the densities in a SH l=0 image:

            `$ mrcalc ODF_CSF.mif 4 pi -mult -sqrt -div ODF_CSF_scaled.mif`

            This applies the spherical harmonic basis scaling factor: 1.0/sqrt(4*pi),
            such that a single-tissue voxel containing the same intensities as the
            response function of that tissue should contain the value 1.0.
