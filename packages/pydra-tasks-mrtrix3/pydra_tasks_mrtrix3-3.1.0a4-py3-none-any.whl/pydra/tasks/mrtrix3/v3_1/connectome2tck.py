class Connectome2Tck(shell.Task["Connectome2Tck.Outputs"]):
    """The compulsory input file "assignments_in" should contain a text file where there is one row for each streamline, and each row contains a list of numbers corresponding to the parcels to which that streamline was assigned (most typically there will be two entries per streamline, one for each endpoint; but this is not strictly a requirement). This file will most typically be generated using the tck2connectome command with the -out_assignments option.


        Example usages
        --------------


        Default usage:

        `$ connectome2tck tracks.tck assignments.txt edge-`

        The command will generate one track file for every edge in the connectome, with the name of each file indicating the nodes connected via that edge; for instance, all streamlines connecting nodes 23 and 49 will be written to file "edge-23-49.tck".


        Extract only the streamlines between nodes 1 and 2:

        `$ connectome2tck tracks.tck assignments.txt tracks_1_2.tck -nodes 1,2 -exclusive -files single`

        Since only a single edge is of interest, this example provides only the two nodes involved in that edge to the -nodes option, adds the -exclusive option so that only streamlines for which both assigned nodes are in the list of nodes of interest are extracted (i.e. only streamlines connecting nodes 1 and 2 in this example), and writes the result to a single output track file.


        Extract the streamlines connecting node 15 to all other nodes in the parcellation, with one track file for each edge:

        `$ connectome2tck tracks.tck assignments.txt from_15_to_ -nodes 15 -keep_self`

        The command will generate the same number of track files as there are nodes in the parcellation: one each for the streamlines connecting node 15 to every other node; i.e. "from_15_to_1.tck", "from_15_to_2.tck", "from_15_to_3.tck", etc.. Because the -keep_self option is specified, file "from_15_to_15.tck" will also be generated, containing those streamlines that connect to node 15 at both endpoints.


        For every node, generate a file containing all streamlines connected to that node:

        `$ connectome2tck tracks.tck assignments.txt node -files per_node`

        Here the command will generate one track file for every node in the connectome: "node1.tck", "node2.tck", "node3.tck", etc.. Each of these files will contain all streamlines that connect the node of that index to another node in the connectome (it does not select all tracks connecting a particular node, since the -keep_self option was omitted and therefore e.g. a streamline that is assigned to node 41 will not be present in file "node41.tck"). Each streamline in the input tractogram will in fact appear in two different output track files; e.g. a streamline connecting nodes 8 and 56 will be present both in file "node8.tck" and file "node56.tck".


        Get all streamlines that were not successfully assigned to a node pair:

        `$ connectome2tck tracks.tck assignments.txt unassigned.tck -nodes 0 -keep_self -files single`

        Node index 0 corresponds to streamline endpoints that were not successfully assigned to a node. As such, by selecting all streamlines that are assigned to "node 0" (including those streamlines for which neither endpoint is assigned to a node due to use of the -keep_self option), the single output track file will contain all streamlines for which at least one of the two endpoints was not successfully assigned to a node.


        Generate a single track file containing edge exemplar trajectories:

        `$ connectome2tck tracks.tck assignments.txt exemplars.tck -files single -exemplars nodes.mif`

        This produces the track file that is required as input when attempting to display connectome edges using the streamlines or streamtubes geometries within the mrview connectome tool.
