    """This command uses the image data from all selected single-fibre voxels concurrently, rather than simply averaging their individual spherical harmonic coefficients. It also ensures that the response function is non-negative, and monotonic (i.e. its amplitude must increase from the fibre direction out to the orthogonal plane).

        If multi-shell data are provided, and one or more b-value shells are not explicitly requested, the command will generate a response function for every b-value shell (including b=0 if present).
