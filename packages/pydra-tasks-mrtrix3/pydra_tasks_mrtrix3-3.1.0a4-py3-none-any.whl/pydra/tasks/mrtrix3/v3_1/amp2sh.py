    """The spherical harmonic decomposition is calculated by least-squares linear fitting to the amplitude data.

        The directions can be defined either as a DW gradient scheme (for example to compute the SH representation of the DW signal), a set of [az el] pairs as output by the dirgen command, or a set of [ x y z ] directions in Cartesian coordinates. The DW gradient scheme or direction set can be supplied within the input image header or using the -gradient or -directions option. Note that if a direction set and DW gradient scheme can be found, the direction set will be used by default.

        The spherical harmonic coefficients are stored according to the conventions described in the main documentation, which can be found at the following link:
