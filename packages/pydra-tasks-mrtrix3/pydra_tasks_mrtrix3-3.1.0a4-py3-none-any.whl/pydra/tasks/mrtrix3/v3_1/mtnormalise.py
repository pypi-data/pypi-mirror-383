class MtNormalise(shell.Task["MtNormalise.Outputs"]):
    """This command takes as input any number of tissue components (e.g. from multi-tissue CSD) and outputs corresponding normalised tissue components corrected for the effects of (residual) intensity inhomogeneities. Intensity normalisation is performed by optimising the voxel-wise sum of all tissue compartments towards a constant value, under constraints of spatial smoothness (polynomial basis of a given order). Different to the Raffelt et al. 2017 abstract, this algorithm performs this task in the log-domain instead, with added gradual outlier rejection, different handling of the balancing factors between tissue compartments, and a different iteration structure.

        The -mask option is mandatory and is optimally provided with a brain mask (such as the one obtained from dwi2mask earlier in the processing pipeline). Outlier areas with exceptionally low or high combined tissue contributions are accounted for and reoptimised as the intensity inhomogeneity estimation becomes more accurate.


        Example usages
        --------------


        Default usage (for 3-tissue CSD compartments):

        `$ mtnormalise wmfod.mif wmfod_norm.mif gm.mif gm_norm.mif csf.mif csf_norm.mif -mask mask.mif`

        Note how for each tissue compartment, the input and output images are provided as a consecutive pair.
