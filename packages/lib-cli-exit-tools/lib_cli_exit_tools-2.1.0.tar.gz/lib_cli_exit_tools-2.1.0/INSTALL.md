# Installation Guide

This document collects every supported installation path for `lib_cli_exit_tools`, plus notes on platform quirks and troubleshooting. If you only need the standard release from PyPI, see the short "Install" section in `README.md` or run:

```bash
pip install lib_cli_exit_tools
```

The sections below cover more specialised workflows, from editable installs to alternate Python tooling.

## Supported Python Versions

`lib_cli_exit_tools` targets Python 3.13 and newer. Wheels are published for CPython on Linux, macOS, and Windows. For alternative interpreters (PyPy) install from source using `pip install lib_cli_exit_tools`.

## Installation Flows

### PyPI (latest release)

The quickest path for production use:

```bash
pip install lib_cli_exit_tools
# Pin to a specific release when reproducibility matters
pip install "lib_cli_exit_tools==X.Y.Z"
# Upgrade later
pip install --upgrade lib_cli_exit_tools
```

This command registers the `lib_cli_exit_tools`, `cli-exit-tools`, and `lib-cli-exit-tools` entry points on your PATH.

### Editable install in a virtual environment

Use this flow when developing the library locally:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .[dev]
# Alternatively, install runtime dependencies only
pip install .
```

### Per-user installs (`pip --user`)

Install to the user site-packages directory without creating a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install --user lib_cli_exit_tools
```

Ensure `~/.local/bin` (POSIX) or `%APPDATA%\Python\PythonXY\Scripts` (Windows) is on your PATH. This approach respects [PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/)—avoid running it in system-managed Python installs that disallow modifications.

### pipx

`pipx` isolates CLI tools in dedicated environments, making upgrades easy:

```bash
pipx install lib_cli_exit_tools
pipx upgrade lib_cli_exit_tools
# Install directly from a tagged release or commit
pipx install "git+https://github.com/bitranox/lib_cli_exit_tools@vX.Y.Z"
```

### uv

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) provides fast installs and execution:

```bash
uv pip install -e .[dev]
uv tool install lib_cli_exit_tools
uvx lib-cli-exit-tools --help  # aliases: cli-exit-tools, lib_cli_exit_tools
```

### Installing from local artifacts

Build a wheel or sdist locally and install it in offline environments:

```bash
python -m build
pip install dist/lib_cli_exit_tools-*.whl
pip install dist/lib_cli_exit_tools-*.tar.gz
```

### Poetry / PDM

Add the library to a project managed by Poetry or PDM:

```bash
# Poetry
poetry add lib_cli_exit_tools
poetry install

# PDM
pdm add lib_cli_exit_tools
pdm install
```

### Install directly from Git

CI systems or early adopters can install from a specific revision:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/bitranox/lib_cli_exit_tools@vX.Y.Z#egg=lib_cli_exit_tools"
```

We distribute via PyPI only. If you prefer isolated CLI installs, use tools such as `pipx` or `uv tool install` with the published wheel/sdist. Third-party packaging recipes (Conda, Homebrew, Nix) have been removed.

## Path configuration

After installation the following commands should resolve:

- `lib_cli_exit_tools`
- `cli-exit-tools`
- `python -m lib_cli_exit_tools`

If you installed inside a virtual environment, activate it before running the commands. For user installs, ensure the relevant `bin`/`Scripts` directory is included in your PATH:

- Linux/macOS venv: `<venv>/bin`
- Linux/macOS user site: `~/.local/bin`
- Windows venv: `<venv>\Scripts`
- Windows user site: `%APPDATA%\Python\PythonXY\Scripts`

## Troubleshooting

### PEP 668 “externally managed environment” errors

Some OS distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian) mark the system Python as externally managed. Running `pip install` directly into that interpreter raises an error similar to:

```
error: externally-managed-environment
```

**Fix:**
- Create a virtual environment (`python -m venv .venv`) and install inside it, or
- Use `pipx`, `uv`, or another isolated environment manager.

### Missing command on PATH

If `lib-cli-exit-tools --help` (or the aliases `cli-exit-tools` / `lib_cli_exit_tools`) returns “command not found”, confirm that the installation location is on PATH. The most common fix is adding `~/.local/bin` (POSIX) or `%APPDATA%\Python\PythonXY\Scripts` (Windows) to your PATH environment variable, then re-opening the shell.

### Colour output not appearing

Set `lib_cli_exit_tools.config.traceback_force_color = True` in your application to force Rich to emit coloured tracebacks even when stderr is not detected as a TTY. Alternatively, export `RICH_FORCE_TERMINAL=1` before running the CLI.
