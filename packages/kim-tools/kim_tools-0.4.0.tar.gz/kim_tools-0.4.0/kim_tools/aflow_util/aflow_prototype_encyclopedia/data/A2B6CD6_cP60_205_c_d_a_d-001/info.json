    "comments": "(Wyckoff, 1922) determined this approximate structure.  In his paper, non-zero coordinates were $x_{2} = 1/4$ for the nitrogen (8c) atoms, $x_{3} = v$, ``where $v$ is somewhat less than 0.25,'' for the NH$_{3}$ (24d) molecules, and $x_{4} = y_{4} = 1/4, ~ z_{4} = v'$, where $v'$ ``should not deviate far from 0.'' If we take these coordinates as written the space group becomes $Fm\\overline{3}m$ \\#225 rather than Wyckoff's $Pa\\overline{3}$ \\#205, so we adjusted $v$ and $v'$ slightly to put the system in his space group. \n (Ewald, 1931) gave this the {\\em Strukturbericht} designation $H61$, or $H6_{1}$ in later notation.  (Hermann, 1937) moved it to $I1_{4}$ in their ``list of type descriptions,'' but no other volume of {\\em Strukturbericht} refers to it at all.  Accordingly, we will designate this structure by its original label. \n This structure is an idealized appoximation to the true structure of Ni(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(NH$_{3}$)$_{6}$. (Bigoli, 1971) showed that the correct structure is \\href{current_web_home_dir/A12B2CD12_aP54_2_12i_2i_i_12i-001}{trigonal, with space group $P\\overline{1}$ \\#2}."
