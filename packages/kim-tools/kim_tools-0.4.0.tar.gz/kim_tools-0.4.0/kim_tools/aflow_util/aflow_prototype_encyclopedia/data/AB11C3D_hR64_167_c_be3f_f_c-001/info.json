Later, (Badrtdinov, 2021) placed the compound in the \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB11C3D_hR64_167_c_be3f_f_c-001}{rhombohedral $R\\overline{3}c$ \\#167 space group as shown here}.  When we allow a 0.1{\\AA} uncertainty in the atomic positions the monoclinic structure reduces to the rhombohedral structure.  Given this ambiguity we retain both structures in the library. \n (Badrtdinov, 2021) place the O-I atom in this structure at the (2a) Wyckoff position, however the coordinates they give are for the (2b) site.  This makes the oxygen part of two PO$_{4}$ tetrahedra, rather than leaving it isolated, so we prefer the (2b) site.  The (2b) site can also be derived from the monoclinic structure. \n Hexagonal settings of this structure can be obtained with the option {\\tt --hex}."
