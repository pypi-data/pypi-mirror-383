(Soldate, 1954) suggests that in the H$_{4}$ compounds the hydrogen atoms form a rotating tetrahedra around the boron atoms. \n (Di Cataldo, 2021) predict LaBH$_{8}$ forms in this structure at pressures around 50 GPa, where it would superconduct with $T_{c} = 126$K.  In this case the (32f) sites are fully filled. \n Most authors use NaBH$_{4}$ as the prototype, but since (Renaudin, 2004) provide information on the location of the deuterium atoms we use KBD$_{4}$, with data taken at room temperature, we use this as the prototype."
