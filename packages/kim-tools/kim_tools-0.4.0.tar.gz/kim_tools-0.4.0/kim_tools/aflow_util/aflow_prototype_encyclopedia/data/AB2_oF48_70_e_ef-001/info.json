    "comments": "Early works, {\\em e.g.} (Pearson, 1958), referred to this structure as Mn$_{4}$B, with the same space group and Wyckoff positions. The stoichiometry was fixed by assuming that the (16e) boron positions were only half-occupied. The (Tergenius, 1981) refinement of the structure showed that the (16e) sites were totally filled, fixing the stoichiometry to Mn$_{2}$B. A similar reanalysis showed that the similar structure known as Cr$_{4}$B also had composition Cr$_{2}$B. \n Tergenius gives the atomic positions using the first setting of space group $Fddd$ \\#70. We have translated this into the second setting, where the origin is on an inversion site. As a part of this process the primitive axes were also rotated compared to Tergenius. \n  \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB2_oF48_70_e_ef-001}{Mn$_{2}$B ($D1_{f}$)} and \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB2_oF48_70_e_ef-002}{CuMg$_{2}$ ($C_{b}$)} have the same AFLOW prototype label, AB2\\_oF48\\_70\\_e\\_ef. They are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files."
