    "comments": "Apatite can be formed with most M$^{+2}$ metallic ions replacing the calcium, and many ions (AsO$_{3}$. CO$_{3}$, Si$_{3}$, {\\em etc.}) replacing the phosphate.  While these structures are related to the prototype, they may have slight changes in crystal structure. The phosphate apatites are the main source of phosphorus on Earth. (Hughes, 2002) \n When OH or Cl replaces F, that ion is displaced from the (1a) position to the (4e) position, with $z = 0.1979$ for OH and 0.4323 for Cl. The substitute ion fills half of the (4f) sites. \n In the calcium-rare earth oxides, the extra oxygen atom is on the (2a) site, one of the rare-earth atoms is mixed with calcium on the (4f) site, and the remainder of the rare-earths replace silicon on that (6h) site. \n Other apatite configurations are discussed on the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A14B3C5_hP44_176_e2hi_h_fh-001}{lead apatite} page. \n There is no ICSD or CCDC entry for (Hughes, 2002). Fortunately (Hazrah, 2022) study a large number of apatites from a variety of sources.  Their ICSD entry 137670 closely matches the structure found by (Hughes, 2002)."
