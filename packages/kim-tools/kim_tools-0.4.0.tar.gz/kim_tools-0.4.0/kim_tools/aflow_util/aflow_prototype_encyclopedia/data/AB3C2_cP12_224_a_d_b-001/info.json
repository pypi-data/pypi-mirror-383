We reference the newer version as it is more accessible to the user. \n The (2a) and (6d) sites are 37\\% silver, 48\\% copper, and 0.8\\% iron, giving the observed stoichiometry. \n We arbitrarily assign silver to the (2a) site and copper to the (6c) cite. \n Both papers put the structure in space group $Fd\\overline{3}c$ \\#228, with the atoms occupying the (16a), (32c), and (48d) sites, however these sites are identical to the (2a), (4b) and (6d) sites of space group $Pn\\overline{3}m$ \\#224 with $a_{224} = 1/2 a_{228}$.  AFLOW favors the smaller unit cell, so we assign this structure to space group \\#224. \n In addtion, if the (2a) and (6c) sites are fully alloyed, this becomes the \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB2_cF12_225_a_c-001}{fluorite ($C1$)} structure. \n The reported structure can be viewed by clicking the ``load block'' button and entering a value of 12.2\\,{\\AA}ngstr\\\"{o}m."
