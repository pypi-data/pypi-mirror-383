We have been unable to obtain a copy of the original reference for this structure (Arnfeldt, 1935), so we use the structure from (Villars, 1991, p.3415), which itself is taken from a secondary reference. \n See \\href{current_web_home_dir/A3B2C8_hR13_166_ac_c_ch-002}{the Ba$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$O$_{8}$ page} for ternary compounds with this structure. \n Hexagonal settings of this structure can be obtained with the option {\\tt --hex}."
