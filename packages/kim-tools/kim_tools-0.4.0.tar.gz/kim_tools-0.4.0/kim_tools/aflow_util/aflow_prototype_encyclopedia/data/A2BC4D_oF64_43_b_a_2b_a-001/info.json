After viewing the ICSD entry and consulting the original work we realized our error and correct it here. \n This structure is stable below 121K, and the data was taken at 113K.  The high temperature structure is tetragonal with disordered hydrogen. (Levy, 1954) \n The origin of the $z$-axis is not restricted in space group $Fdd2$ \\#43.  Here it is fixed by putting the phosphorous atom at the origin."
