There is a considerable difference in the structure compared to the \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB4C3_oI32_46_b_2bc_bc-001}{room temperature structure} even though the space group and Wyckoff positions do not change. \n In chemical literature this is often referred to as Ag(tcm), where tcm is an abbreviation for tricyanomethanide. \n We use the ambient pressure structural data taken at 100K after heating."
