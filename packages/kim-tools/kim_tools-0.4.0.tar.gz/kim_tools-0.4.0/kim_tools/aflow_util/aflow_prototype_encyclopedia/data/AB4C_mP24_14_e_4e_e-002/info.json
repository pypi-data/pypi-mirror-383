    "comments": "Monasites (RE-PO$_{4}$) and gasparites (RE-AsO$_{4}$) can have a mixture of rare earth elements in the RE slot of the formula.  Technically these minerals are called monasite-(X) and gasparite-(X), where ``X'' is the predominant rare earth element in the sample.  All of the structures are similar. As we must pick one as the prototype, we take the first entry in (Ni, 1995) to define the class. \n (Ni, 1995) gives the structural data in the $P2_{1}/n$ setting of space group \\#14.  We used FINDSYM to change this to our standard $P2_{1}/c$ setting.  This involves a change of primitive vectors as well as a rotation of the crystal. \n This structure has the same AFLOW label as \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB4C_mP24_14_e_4e_e-001}{(NH$_{4}$SO$_{4}$, $K4_{1}$)}.  The structures are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files."
