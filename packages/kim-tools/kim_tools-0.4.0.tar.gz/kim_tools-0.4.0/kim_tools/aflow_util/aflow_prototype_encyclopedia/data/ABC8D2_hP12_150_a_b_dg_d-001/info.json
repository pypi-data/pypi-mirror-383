    "comments": "This has been a rather difficult structure to follow through the literature.  (Villars, 2016) quotes the structure given by (Manoli, 1970), but gives the space group as $P\\overline{3}$ \\#147. (Murashko, 2013) lists the space group as both $P312$ \\#149 and $P321$ \\#150, as well as listing obviously incorrect Wyckoff positions. \n (West, 2008) states that the simple structure is in $P\\overline{3}$ but that it may be doubled along the $c$ axis and be in space group $P321$. \n After correcting Murashko's results, we find that all of these interpretations yield essentially the same structure in a given layer, and only differ as the structure is reflected through the $z = 0$ plane.  As it is not clear which structure is correct, we will use the original $H3_{2}$ structure given by (Hermann, 1937). \n Steklite is the name of the mineral form of this compound (Murashko, 2013). (Hermann, 1937) simply calls it {\\em Wasserfreier Alaun} (anhydrous alum). For hydrated alum, KAl(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$$\\cdot$12H$_{2}$O, see the \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB24CD28E2_cP224_205_a_4d_b_2c4d_c-001}{$H4_{13}$ structure}."
