(Raeuchle, 1952) described the structure as a somewhat disordered supercell containing 48 atoms with lattice constants $a = 29.44${\\AA} and $c = 7.33${\\AA}, but they stated that a `pseudo-cell' existed with dimensions $a = 4.23${\\AA} and $c = 7.33${\\AA}.  This pseudo-cell is described here, and was designated {\\em Strukturbericht} $D2_{a}$ by Smithells (Brandes, 1992).  Rauchle and Rundle suggested that the larger primitive cell was constructed from the multiple pseudo-cells, with the titanium atom alternating between the $(1a)$ and $(1b)$ Wyckoff positions. \n Other experimenters have suggested that the actual structure of TiBe$_{12}$ is tetragonal.  (Jackson, 2016) presents first-principles calculations which suggest that the actual structure is the tetragonal \\href{current_web_home_dir/A12B_tI26_139_fij_a-001}{ThMn$_{12}$ ($D2_{b}$) type}. \n \\href{current_web_home_dir/A6B6C_hP13_191_i_cde_a-002}{HfFe$_{6}$Ge$_{6}$} is the ternary form of this structure."
