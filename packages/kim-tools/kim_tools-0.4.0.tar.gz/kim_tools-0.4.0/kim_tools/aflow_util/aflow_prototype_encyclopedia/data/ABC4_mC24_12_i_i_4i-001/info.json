In their N00 sample the occupation of our Al site is 80\\% aluminum and 20\\% niobium, with the reverse concentrations on our Nb site. \n (Pederson, 1962) analyzed a sample of AlNbO$_{4}$ assuming that these sites were fully ordered. The atomic positions listed there have some errors, so we used the data found by Ardit {\\em et al.} \n The atomic positions for this structure are not found in the main text.  They are filed as \\href{http://www.minsocam.org/MSA/AmMin/TOC/2012/MJ12_Data/Ardit_p910_12.zip}{item \\#AM-12-035 in the American Mineralogist repository}."
