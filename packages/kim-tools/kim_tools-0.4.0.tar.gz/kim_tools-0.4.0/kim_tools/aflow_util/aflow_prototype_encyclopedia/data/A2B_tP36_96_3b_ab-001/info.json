Wyckoff uses the coordinates proposed by Shropshire and assumes the space group is $P4_{1}2_{1}2$. He then notes that one of the Si-O bonds in this structure is very long (3.69 {\\AA}), and is ``so probable that there is something wrong either with the parameters as stated or the structure itself.'' If we use space group $P4_{3}2_{1}2$ while retaining Shropshire's coordinates we obtain a much more convincing structure, one that looks much like the structure in Shropshire's Fig. 3. For this reason we place this structure in $P4_{3}2_{1}2$."
