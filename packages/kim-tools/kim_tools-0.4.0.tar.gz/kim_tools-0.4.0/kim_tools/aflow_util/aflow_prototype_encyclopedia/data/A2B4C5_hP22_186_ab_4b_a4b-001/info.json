The (2a) and (2b) Wyckoff positions for space group \\#159 are identical to those in the hexagonal space group $P6_{3}mc$ \\#186, so we follow (Cenzual, 1991) and place this in the higher symmetry space group. \n The origin of the $z$-axis in space group $P6_{3}mc$ is arbitrary.  We use the origin specified by (Schuster, 1984). \n Most of the Wyckoff positions in this structure are only partially occupied: \\begin{itemize} \\item Sites Al-I and Ti-I are fully occupied. \\item Sites Ni-I, Ni-II, Ti-II, and Ti-III are 80\\% occupied.  \\item Sites Ni-III, Ni-IV, Ti-IV, and Ti-V are 20\\% occupied. \\end{itemize} ~ \\vspace{-.25in} \n This explains the short Ti-N bond lengths shown in the figure -- for any given Ti-N pair, only one of the two atoms is actually present."
