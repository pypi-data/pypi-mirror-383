    "comments": "This structure is only stable at high pressures and temperatures (Wriedt, 1988). \n Bouvaist, 1970) were able to study a metastable sample at 22$^{\\circ}$C. \n They describe the structure using the $P2_{1}/a$ setting of space group \\#14.  We used AFLOW to transform this to the standard $P2_{1}/c$ setting.  This involves a linear transformation of the primitive vectors of the cell. \n The lattice constants reported by (Bouvaist, 2000) differ slightly in the abstract and Table 1.  We use the values provided in the ICSD entry. \n \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B3_mP20_14_2e_3e-002}{Orpiment (As$_{2}$S$_{3}$, $D5_{f}$)} and \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B3_mP20_14_2e_3e-003}{$\\alpha$-Bi$_{2}$O$_{3}$} occupy the same Wyckoff positions in space group $P2_{1}/c$ as \\href{current_web_home_dir/A3B2_mP20_14_3e_2e-001}{Pb$_{2}$O$_{3}$}, but they have different AFLOW labels. The structures are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files."
