The biggest difference between the two structures is the distance between the silicon and titantium atoms, which is 3.81{\\AA} in Hawthorne and a rather short 2{\\AA} in Hermann.  We therefore favor the Hawthorne structure, and, since it does not otherwise substantially change the results, we continue to use $S0_{6}$ to describe it. \n (Hermann, 1937) also listed this as the $H5_{6}$ structure in the index."
