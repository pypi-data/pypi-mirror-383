    "comments": "There is no consistency in the naming convention of selenium structures, and we have generally tried to avoid the Greek-letter-monoclinic form in favor of something less confusing.  This structure, however, has no other name that we are aware of, so we follow (Cherin, 1972) and call it $\\alpha$-monoclinic selenium, a designation followed by (Donohue, 1974). \n Although this structure has the same AFLOW prototype label, A\\_mP32\\_14\\_e, as \\href{current_web_home_dir/A_mP32_14_8e-001}{$\\beta$-Se ($A_{l}$)}, the two structures are distinct. They are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files."
