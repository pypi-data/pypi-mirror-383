For more details about the $\\omega$ phase and materials which form in the $\\omega$ phase see (Sikka, 1982). \n Many $\\omega$ phase intermetallic alloys are disordered, we list some of the ordered structures here. \n In this structure the B-B distance is smaller than the Al-B distance for every $c/a$ ratio. \n If $c/a$ is small enough the structure looks like a set of inter-penetrating boron triangular planes and aluminium chains. \n If $c/a = 1/\\sqrt{3}$ the Al-Al distance along (001) is the same as the B-B distance in the plane, and the B-B distance in the (001) direction. This value 0.577 is close to the value $\\sqrt{3/8} \\, (\\approx 0.612)$ where the trigonal $\\omega$ phase can transform to the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A_cI2_229_a-001}{body-centered cubic (A2)} lattice, which probably explains the close connection between the $\\omega$ and bcc phases. \n In the current sample (Burkhardt, 2004) the aluminum (1a) site has 10\\% vacancies."
