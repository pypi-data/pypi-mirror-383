First-principles calculation by (Cota, 2005) and (Chen, 2011) suggest that the F\\\"{o}ppl structure is correct, but show that the proper space group is $P6_{3}/mmc$ \\#194.  This is generally held to be the correct structure, {\\em e.g.} (Jain, 2013).  We use the symmetrization of F\\\"{o}ppl's original data made by (Cota, 2005). \n The ICSD entry is from F\\\"{o}ppl, 1957), updated to make the space group $P6_{3}/mmc$."
