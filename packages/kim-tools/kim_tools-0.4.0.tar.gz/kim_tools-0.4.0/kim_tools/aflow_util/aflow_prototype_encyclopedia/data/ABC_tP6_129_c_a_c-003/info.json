They are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files. \n Indeed, (Potapova, 1977) state that PrOI is a Matlockite structure, but both AFLOW and the ICSD agree that they are different enough to warrant listing them as separate prototypes. \n In both cases we have $z_{3} \\approx - z_{2}$.  We somewhat arbitrarily assign structures with the min($z_{2}$,$z_{3}$) $<$ 0.199 to the PrOI structure and those with larger values to the Matlockite structure. \n Binary forms of Matlockite/PrOI occur when the species on the (2a) site is the same as one of the species on the (2c) sites.  We assign these structures to the prototypes: \\begin{itemize} \\item \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B_tP6_129_ac_c-001}{Cu$_{2}$Sb ($C38$)} for structures with c/a $<$ 2, \\item \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B_tP6_129_ac_c-002}{UP$_{2}$} for structures with 2 $<$ c/a $<$ 3, and \\item \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB2_tP6_129_c_ac-003}{LaSe$_{1.85}$} for structures with c/a $\\approx$ 4. \\end{itemize} ~ \\vspace{-.25in} \n (Potapova, 1977) give this structure in setting 1 of space group $P4/nmm$ \\#129.  We shifted the origin to put it into our standard setting 2."
