The data presented here was computed at 70~GPa. \n 70 GPa H$_{2}$S has the same AFLOW label as \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B_oP12_26_abc_ab-002}{$\\beta$-SeO$_{2}$}, A2B\\_oP12\\_26\\_abc\\_ab. The structures are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files."
