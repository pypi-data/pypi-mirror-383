For simplicity we place the atoms on the (2d) site.\n The X-ray scattering of an F$^{-}$ ion is almost identical to that of O$^{-2}$, and Lundberg was not able to distinguish between them.  She arbitrarily designated the (2f) site she called O$_{4}$ as the location of the fluorine ion and we follow this, but in reality we have no idea if the F$^{-}$ ions are located on this site, are ordered on another site, or are statistically distributed on the oxygen sites. \n The ICSD entry does not place the lithium atoms."
