On the other hand, the ICSD entry gives lists 98\\% occupation, which is in better agreement with the claimed stoichiometry. \n This structure has the same AFLOW label as \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B_oP12_60_d_c-001}{$\\zeta$-Fe$_{2}$N}, but in that case the nitrogen site is fully occupied. The structures are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files."
