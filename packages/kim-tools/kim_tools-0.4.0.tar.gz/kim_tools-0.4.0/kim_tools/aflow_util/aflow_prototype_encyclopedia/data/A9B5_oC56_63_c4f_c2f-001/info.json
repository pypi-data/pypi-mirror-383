    "comments": "This structure goes by various names:  (Pearson, 1967) calls it Ni$_{6}$S$_{5}$, while (Villars, 2018) calls it Ni$_{5.6}$S$_{4.9}$ or $\\gamma$-Ni$_{7}$S$_{6}$.  This confusion exists because most of the sites are only partially occupied: \\begin{itemize} \\item The Ni I (4c) site has 96.5\\% occupation. \\item The S  I (4c) site is fully occupied. \\item The Ni II (8f) site has 43.6\\% occupation. \\item The Ni III (8f) site has 91.9\\% occupation. \\item The Ni IV (8f) site has 51.8\\% occupation. \\item The Ni V (8f) site has 45.9\\% occupation. \\item The S I (8f) site has 98.5\\% occupation. \\item The S II (8f) site has 94.5\\% occupation. \\end{itemize} ~ \\vspace{-.25in} \n Thus the stoichiometry of this system is Ni$_{22.516}$S$_{19.440}$, Ni$_{7}$S$_{6.044}$, or Ni$_{5.6}$S$_{4.83}$.  Allowing for rounding, Ni$_{7}$S$_{6}$ seems to be the best choice. \n (Villars, 2018) gives this as a high-temperature structure, stable in the range 520-800K, with the exact boundaries depending on the composition. \n (Fleet, 1972) gives the structure in the $Bmmb$ setting of space group \\#63.  We used FINDSYM to transform this to the standard $Cmcm$ setting."
