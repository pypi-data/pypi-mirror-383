The labels we have assigned to each site are purely for convenience. \n According to (Konnert, 1976), the composition of each site is: \\begin{itemize} \\item (1a) 50\\% Fe \\item (1c) 50\\% Fe \\item (1e) 36\\% Fe, 16\\% Mg (labeled Mg) \\item (1g) 20\\% Sn, 27\\% Fe (labeled Sn here) \\item Metallic (2n) 50\\% Fe, 48\\% Mg (labeled Mg). \\item The boron and oxygen sites are fully occupied. \\end{itemize} ~ \\vspace{-.25in} \n We have switched the $a$ and $c$ axis from that defined by (Konnert, 1976). This swaps the (1a) and (1g) Wyckoff positions, while the (1d) Wyckoff postion becomes (1c) and (1f) becomes (1e)."
