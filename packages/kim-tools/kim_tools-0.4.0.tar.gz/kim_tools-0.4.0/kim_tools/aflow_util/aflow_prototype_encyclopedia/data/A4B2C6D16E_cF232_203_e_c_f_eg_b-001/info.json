The two structures are not very different with an uncertainty in atomic positions of less than 1{\\AA} bringing them into agreement. \n This page describes the new structure. \n For the (Shiba, 1931) structure \\href{current_web_home_dir/A4B2C6D16E_cF232_227_e_c_f_eg_b-001}{see the $H5_{6}$ page}."
