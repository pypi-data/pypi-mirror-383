    "comments": "(Gottfried, 1938) gave the $E1_{3}$ designation to Cd(NH$_{3}$)$_{2}$Cl$_{2}$, and gave coordinates in the $Cmm2$ \\#35 space group.  However, the cited reference, (MacGillavry, 1936) noted that their coordinates allowed several different space groups, with $Cmmm$ \\#65 having the highest symmetry.  We therefore follow most authors and use the $Cmmm$ representation. \n (MacGillavry, 1936) could not determine the positions of the hydrogen atoms, but (Leineweber, 1999) was able to do this using the isostructural compound Mg(NH$_{3}$)$_{2}$Cl$_{2}$.  Accordingly we us Mg(NH$_{3}$)$_{2}$Cl$_{2}$ for the prototype of $E1_{3}$. \n Twelve hydrogen atoms are statistically distributed among the (16r) positions, giving each site 75\\% occupation."
