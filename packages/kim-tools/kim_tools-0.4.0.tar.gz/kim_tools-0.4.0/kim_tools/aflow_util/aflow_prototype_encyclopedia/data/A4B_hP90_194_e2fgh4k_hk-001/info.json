    "comments": "If we use the (Wang, 1965) coordinate $x_{6} = 0.0478$ the Sr-I (6h) atom we get distances that do not agree with their listed interatomic distances, and some distances are too short and physically unreasonable.  (Villars, 2016) solved this by assuming the ``0'' in front of the ''478'' in Table 3 was extraneous, and that the number should actually be ``-0.478.''  This makes the distances much more reasonable, although still not exactly in agreement with (Wang, 1965).  It is also in agreement with the ICSD entry and in near agreement with first-principles relaxed structure found by the Materials Project (Jain, 2103).  Accordingly we use ``0.522'' (1 - 0.478) for $x_{6}$. \n Although (Villars, 2016) imply that the actually stoichiometry of this system is Sr$_{9}$Mg$_{38}$, the stoichiometry in their description is SrMg$_{4}$."
