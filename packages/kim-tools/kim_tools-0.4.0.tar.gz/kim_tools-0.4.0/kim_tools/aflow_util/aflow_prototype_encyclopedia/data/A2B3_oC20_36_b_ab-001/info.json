The ground state is \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B3_hP15_152_c_ac-001}{trigonal}. \n Data was taken a 6.5 GPa.  (Prewitt, 1968) give the structure in the $Ccm2_{1}$ setting of space group \\#36.  We used FINDSYM to transform it to the standard $Cmc2_{1}$ setting.  This space group allows for an arbitrary placement of the origin of the $z$-axis, which we fixed by setting $z_{1} = 0$ for the O-I (2a) Wyckoff position. \n The ICSD 34685 website entry for this structure states that it was refined at ambient pressure, but the data is consistent with the high-pressure structure shown here."
