It is likely that the hydrogen atoms are freely rotating around the nitrogen, as any reasonable fixed positions would destroy both the inversion symmetry and the four-fold rotation axis exhibited by space group $P4/mmm$ \\#123. \n (Harmsen, 1939) and (Herrmann, 1943) give multiple possible space groups for this structure.  We have chosen the highest symmetry representation, space group $P4/mmm$."
