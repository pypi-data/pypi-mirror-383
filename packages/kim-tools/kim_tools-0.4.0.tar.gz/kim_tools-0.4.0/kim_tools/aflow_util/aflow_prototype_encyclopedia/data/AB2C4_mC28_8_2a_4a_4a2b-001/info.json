We used FINDSYM to transform it to the standard $Cm$, unique axis $b$ setting. Although they never give a value, we assume $\\alpha = 90^{\\circ}$, as the other lattice parameters are the same as in the $Cmca$ phase. \n (Rehuis, 2006) made several mistakes in the labeling of the Wyckoff positions in the $Bm11$ section of Table I: \\begin{itemize} \\item The copper sites labeled (4a) are actually (2a). \\item The oxygen sites labeled (4a) are actually (4b). \\end{itemize}"
