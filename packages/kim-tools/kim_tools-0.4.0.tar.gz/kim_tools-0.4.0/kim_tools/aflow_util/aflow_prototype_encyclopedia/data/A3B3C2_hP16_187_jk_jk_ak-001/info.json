Several of these compounds have been found to superconduct at temperatures on the order of 5-10K. \n The ICSD entry is for Rb$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$As$_{3}$ from (Zhao, 2020). The ICSD entry lists that as the prototype, but (Bao, 2015) obviously found K$_{2}$Cr$_{3}$As$_{3}$ earlier, so we continue using it as our prototype."
