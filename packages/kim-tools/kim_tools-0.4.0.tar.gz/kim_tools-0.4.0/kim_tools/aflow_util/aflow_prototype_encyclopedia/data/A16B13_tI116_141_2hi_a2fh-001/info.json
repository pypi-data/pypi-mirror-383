The result is shown here. \n However, (Andersson, 1970) call this structure a distorted \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB_cF8_225_a_b-001}{rock salt ($B1$) structure} with vacancies on the vanadium sites and interstitial vanadium atoms on the (4a) sites, and our structure look nothing like this. \n Furthermore, the (presumably relaxed) structure found on the Materials Project page (Jain, 2013) has the same symmetry and occupied Wyckoff positions, but is actually much different than this structure. \n We fill investigate this further.  If updates are necessary we will revise this page."
