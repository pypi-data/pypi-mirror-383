We do not have a copy of that publication, so we use the data given in (Gladyshevskii, 1992). \n The ICSD entry for this paper is for the isostructural compound Er$_{2}$RhSi$_{3}$. \n This structure is closely related to what we call the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2BC3_hP24_190_bh_f_i-001}{Er$_{2}$RhSi$_{3}$ structure}, which lacks the inversion symmetry of this structure. See the discussion there and in (Gladyshevskii, 1992)."
