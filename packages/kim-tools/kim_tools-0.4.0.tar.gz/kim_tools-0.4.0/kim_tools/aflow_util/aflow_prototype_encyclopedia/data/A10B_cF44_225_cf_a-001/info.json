Its existence was confirmed by (Geballe, 2018). \n The lattice constant $a = 4.78${\\AA} is taken from (Liu, 2017) prediction at 300 GPa. (Geballe, 2018) found $a = 5.09${\\AA} at 172 GPa. \n (Liu, 2017) give a list of hydrogen positions which are not compatible with space group $Fm\\overline{3}m$ \\#225.  The positions we assigned are consistent with the work of (Geballe, 2018)."
