Neither paper notes the positions of the hydrogen atoms, but under the assumption that the structure is similar to \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2BC_tI16_140_h_d_a-001}{KHF$_{2}$ ($F5_{2}$)}, (Downs, 2003) puts some of them between pairs of fluorine atoms. The remaining hydrogen atoms are part of the NH$_{4}$ radical. \n The crystal structure was given in the $Pman$ setting of space group \\#53.  We used FINDSYM to change it to the standard $Pmna$ structure."
