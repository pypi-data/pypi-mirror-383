We arbitrarily place it on the (2a) site. \n The coordinates of the Zn-II atom given in (Brown, 1962) are not consistent with Figure 5 and Table 4 in that paper, and the Co-Zn-II distance is much too small.  By shifting the $x$-coordinate by 1/2, from 0.111 to 0.611, we obtain excellent agreement with both figure and table."
