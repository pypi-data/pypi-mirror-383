This partial occupancy gives a structure that differs slightly from the $H2_{2}$ structure described by (Ewald, 1928). There the hydrogen atoms are at their averaged positions, Wyckoff position (8d). \n The x position of the oxygen atom was inadvertantly listed as 0.1933.  We have changed this to the correct value, 0.14933"
