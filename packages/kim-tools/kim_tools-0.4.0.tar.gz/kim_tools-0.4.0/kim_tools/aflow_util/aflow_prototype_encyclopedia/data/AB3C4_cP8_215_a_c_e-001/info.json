The actual composition of the sample under study is Cu$_{3}$(As$_{0.65}$Cu$_{0.20}$Fe$_{0.13}$)S$_{4}$. We will ignore the alloying on the arsenic site here. \n (Sclar, 1960) set $x_{3} = 1/4$, but that is not required by symmetry and there is undoubtedly some relaxation. \n After much searching we finally obtained the original article for this structure from the \\href{https://archive.org/details/sim_geological-society-of-america-bulletin_1960-12_71_12_0/page/1970/mode/1up}{Internet Archive}.  We thank them for making these documents available."
