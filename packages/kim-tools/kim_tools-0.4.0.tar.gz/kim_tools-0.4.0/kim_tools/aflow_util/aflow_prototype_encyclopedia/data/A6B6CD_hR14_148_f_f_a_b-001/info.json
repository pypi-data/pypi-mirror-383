(Hermann, 1937) gave this the {\\em Strukturbericht} designation $I6_{1}$.  (Gottfried, 1937) changed the $I$ designations to $J$, so this should have become $J6_{1}$, but it was never referenced in any form in later volumes of {\\em Strukturbericht}.  Since $I6_{1}$ is the only designation for this structure in the literature, we we use it rather than $J1_{6}$."
