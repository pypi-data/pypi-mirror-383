    "comments": "The structure of AgMnO$_{4}$ was originally determined by (Sasv\\'{a}ri, 1938) and refined by (Boonstra, 1968).  In particular, Boonstra found that the actual positions of the Ag and Mn atoms were switched compared to the structure found by Sasv\\'{a}ri.  As the lattice constants remain approximately the same and there was no change in the space group or the occupied Wyckoff positions, we use the Boonstra structure to define {\\em Strukturbericht} designation $H0_{9}$. \n Boonstra gave the structure in setting $P2_{1}/n$ of space group \\#14. We used FINDSYM to translate the structure to the standard $P2_{1}/c$ setting.  This included a redefinition of the primitive vectors of the lattice. \n This structure has the same AFLOW label as \\href{current_web_home_dir/ABC4_mP24_14_e_e_4e-002}{GaPS$_{4}$}.  The structures are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files."
