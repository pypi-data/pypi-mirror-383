We use the compositions in the American Mineralogist Crystal Structure Database (Downs, 2003): \\begin{itemize} \\item The K (2a) site is 91\\% potassium and 1\\% iron, with the remainder of the sites vacant. \\item The Mg (4c) site is 99\\% magnesium/aluminum and 1\\% iron. \\item The Al (6f) site is mostly aluminum/magnesium with a trace of iron/manganese/titanium, even though in Table 4 they call it an Fe site. \\item The Si (24m) site is 86\\% silicon and 14\\% magnesium. \\item The oxygen sites are all filled. \\end{itemize} ~ \\vspace{-.25in} \n These compositions are very dependent upon where the sample was found.  See Table 5 in (Armbruster, 1988) for more details."
