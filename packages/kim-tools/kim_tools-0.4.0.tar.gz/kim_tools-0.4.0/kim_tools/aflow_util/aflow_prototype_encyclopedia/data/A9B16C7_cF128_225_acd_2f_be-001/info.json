It is not meant to represent a real steel, and the selection of atom types for each Wyckoff position is arbitrary. \n If we set $x_{5} = 1/4, x_{6} = 1/8$, and $x_{7} = 3/8$ and replace the nickel atoms by chromium, this structure reverts to \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB_cP2_221_a_b-002}{CsCl ($B2$)} with $a_{B2} = 1/4 a$.  \n If we replace both the nickel and chromium atoms by iron the structure becomes \\href{current_web_home_dir/A_cI2_229_a-001}{a body-centered cubic lattice ($A2$)} again with $a_{A2} = 1/4 a$."
