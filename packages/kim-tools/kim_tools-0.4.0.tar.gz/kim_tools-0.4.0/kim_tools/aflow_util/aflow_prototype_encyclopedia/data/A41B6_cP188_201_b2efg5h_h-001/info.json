We use the data taken at 298K. \n (Armbr\\\"{u}ster, 2000) give the structure of Ce$_{6}$Cd$_{37}$ in setting 1 of space group $Pn\\overline{3}$ \\#201.  We used FINDSYM to change this to the standard setting 2. \n (Armbr\\\"{u}ster, 2000) also present a slightly different version of the YCd$_{6}$ structure than that presented in the prototype paper, (Larson, 1972). \n We used FINDSYM to transform this to the standard second setting, which places a cerium atom and the inversion site at the origin."
