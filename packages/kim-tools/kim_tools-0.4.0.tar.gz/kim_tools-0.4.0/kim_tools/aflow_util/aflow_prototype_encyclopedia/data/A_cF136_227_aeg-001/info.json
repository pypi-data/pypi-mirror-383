In nature these structures are stabilized by alkali impurity atoms. \n This structure and the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A_cP46_223_cik-001}{Si$_{46}$ structure} are proposed ``pure'' silicon clathrate structures. \n For more information about these structures and their possible stability, see (Adams, 1994). \n See (Gryko, 2000) for a possible experimental realization of this structure (Si$_{34}$Na$_{x}$, were x is very small). \n We have used the fact that all vectors of the form $(0,\\pm a/2,\\pm a/2)$, $(\\pm a/2,0,\\pm a/2)$, and $(\\pm a/2,\\pm a/2,0)$ are primitive vectors of the face-centered cubic lattice to simplify the positions of some atoms in both lattice and Cartesian coordinates. \n (Dong, 1999) study a similar, but not identical structure (ICSD 56271), and (Schwarz, 2008) find a similar high-pressure phase of germanium (ICSD 245948)."
