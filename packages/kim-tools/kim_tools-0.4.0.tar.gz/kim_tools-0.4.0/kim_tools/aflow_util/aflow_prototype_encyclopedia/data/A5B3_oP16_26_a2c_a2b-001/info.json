Below $300^{\\circ}$ it transforms into the ordered Au$_{5}$Zn$_{3}$ structure. \n There is considerable disorder on most of the sites in this system, to wit: \\begin{itemize} \\item Site Au-I (2a) is 60\\% gold and 40 \\% zinc, \\item Site Zn-I (2c) is 20\\% gold and 80 \\% zinc, \\item Site Zn-II (2b) is 10\\% gold and 90 \\% zinc, \\item Site Zn-III (2b) is 40\\% gold and 60 \\% zinc, \\item Site Au-II (4c) is 85\\% gold and 15 \\% zinc, and \\item Site Au-III (4c) is 100\\% gold with no zinc. \\end{itemize} ~ \\vspace{-.25in} \n We label each site by its dominant component. \n (Iwaskai, 1965) gave the lattice constants in kX units.  We used the conversion factor 1 kX = 1.00202{\\AA}. (Wood, 1947). \n The ICSD entry is from (Iwasaki, 1962)."
