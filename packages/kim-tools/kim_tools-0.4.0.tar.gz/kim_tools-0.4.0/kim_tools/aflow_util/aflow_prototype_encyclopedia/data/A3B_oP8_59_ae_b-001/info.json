Wyckoff positions have been deduced from the structure of Cu$_{3}$Sb, which Villars (1991) lists as having the TiCu$_{3}$ structure. \n Atomic positions are set to give the approximate nearest-neighbor distances listed in Pearson. \n (Giessen, 1971) says that the (Karlsson, 1951) structure of $\\beta$-TiCu$_{3}$ is mistaken. They do find a metastable $\\beta$-TiCu$_{3}$ phase which has the same space group and Wyckoff positions, but substantially different lattice constants than the original determination for $\\beta$-TiCu$_{3}$. \n The ICSD entry is from (Karlsson, 1951)."
