    "comments": "(Mark, 1925) studied a variety of B$_{2}$H$_{6}$ structures, including the one given {\\em Strukturbericht} designation $D4_{1}$ by (Ewald,1931). Very little information was given about this structure, other than Ewalds's statement ``The position of the boron atoms is exactly the same as that of the Hg atoms in the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A_hR1_166_a-002}{A10 ($\\alpha$-Hg) structure}.'' (Yao, 2011) found the current structure computationally, and note that it is likely the structure found by (Mark, 1925). \n This structure shares the same AFLOW designation, AB3\\_mP16\\_14\\_e\\_3e, as the \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB3_mP16_14_e_3e-003}{$\\beta$-B$_{2}$H$_{6}$} structure described by (Smith, 1965).  They are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files."
