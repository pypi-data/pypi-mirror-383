(Drozdov, 2015) found a superconductor in the hydrogen-sulfur system at 203 K and pressure near 200 GPa. (Bernstein, 2015) showed that this structure is the ground state of the H\u2013S system near 200 GPa. Both La$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and Nd$_{2}$O$_{3}$ can form in this structure under ambient conditions, but in both cases the oxygen atoms occupy only 50\\% of the (6b) Wyckoff positions. \n We have used the fact that all vectors of the form $(\\pm a/2 \\hat{x} \\pm a/2 \\hat{y} \\pm a/2 \\hat{z})$ are primitive vectors of the body-centered cubic lattice to simplify the positions of some atoms in both lattice and Cartesian coordinates. \n The oxides with this structure have a large number of defects, with the oxygen (6b) sites only partially filled."
