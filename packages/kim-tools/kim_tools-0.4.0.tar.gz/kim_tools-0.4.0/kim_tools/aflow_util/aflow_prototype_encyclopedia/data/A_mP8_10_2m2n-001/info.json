Shortly after this paper was published, two other papers predicted similar structures, differentiated mainly by an origin shift: \n F-carbon (Tian 2012): the origin is shifted by $\\frac12 \\, \\mathbf{a_3}$. \n  J-carbon (Wang, 2012): the origin is shifted by $\\frac12 \\left(\\mathbf{a_1} + \\mathbf{a_3}\\right)$. \n This is {\\em not} the orthorhombic phase found by (He, 2012), which was also called S-carbon."
