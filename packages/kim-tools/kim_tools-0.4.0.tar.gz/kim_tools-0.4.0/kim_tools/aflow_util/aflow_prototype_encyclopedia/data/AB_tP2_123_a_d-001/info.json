(Pearson, 1958; Bjerkelund, 1967) \n For $x > 0.5$ this transforms to the CuAu(II) phase above 390$^\\circ$C.  This phase is orthorhombic with $a$ and $c$ only changing slightly but $b \\approx 10 a$. This phase also exists at 200$^\\circ$C for $0.33 < x < 0.65$, excluding the range where CuAu(I) forms. (Pearson, 1958) \n (Ewald, 1931) and later (Pearson, 1958) both doubled the unit cell and gave this structure the Pearson symbol $tP4$. \n $L1_{0}$ has $c/a \\approx \\sqrt{2}$, characteristic of face-centered cubic ordering, while $L2_{a}$ has $c/a \\approx 1$, a body-centered cubic-like system. This structure has the same AFLOW designation, AB\\_tP2\\_123\\_a\\_d, as \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB_tP2_123_a_d-002}{$\\delta$-CuTi ($L2_{a}$)}. The only difference in the structures is the c/a ratio. They are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files. \n We previously used the data from (Bayless, 1990), but we switched to (Bjerkelund, 1967) to match the ICSD entry."
