    "comments": "This is often referred to as Ag$_{3.6}$Gd.  Sources such as (Wang, 2008) list this as Ag$_{51}$Gd$_{14}$, but the exact stoichiometry depends on the occupation of the Ag-III (6j) site.  If this site is half-filled we get the preferred stoichiometry.  The Al (6j) sites are quite close together, forming a hexagon of side 1.57{\\AA} with second neighbors at 2.72{\\AA}.  When the site is half filled it is likely that the three silver atoms form a triangle with side 2.57{\\AA} in one of the two allow orientations."
