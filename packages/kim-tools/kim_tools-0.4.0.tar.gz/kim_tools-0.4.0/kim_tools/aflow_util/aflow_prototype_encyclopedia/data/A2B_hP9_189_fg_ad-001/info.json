As noted by (Wyckoff, 1963), that structure was ``generally accepted for years, [but] has recently been shown to be incorrect.'' This is the corrected structure, as given in Wyckoff and (Villars, 1991). See the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B_hP9_150_ef_ad-001}{original Fe$_{2}$P ($C22$) page} for the {\\em Strukturbericht} version of this crystal. \n This is the binary version of the structure.  There are two possible tenary versions: \\begin{itemize} \\item  The two iron sites are independent, and can be replaced by different atoms.  We put the resulting ternary structures under the \\href{current_web_home_dir/ABC_hP9_189_f_bc_g-003}{ZrNiAl prototype}. \\item The two potassium sites are also independent, that ternary structure can be represented by \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2BC6_hP9_189_c_b_fg-002}{Zr$_{6}$CoAs$_{2}$}. \\end{itemize} ~ \\vspace{-.25in} \n The quaternary version of this structure has different species on all four Wyckoff sites.  We represent this by the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B3CD3_hP9_189_c_f_b_g-001}{Tb$_{3}$Mn$_{3}$Ga$_{2}$Si structure}."
