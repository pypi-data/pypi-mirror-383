While we believe that this work is correct, we present both structures. \n (Dadsetani, 2011) only gave one (16f) position for the lithium atoms, so we generated the other two sets by taking $x \\rightarrow y \\rightarrow z \\rightarrow x$. \n ICSD entry 186820 is no longer in the database.  This suggests that this structure was withdrawn, but we have no confirmation of that."
