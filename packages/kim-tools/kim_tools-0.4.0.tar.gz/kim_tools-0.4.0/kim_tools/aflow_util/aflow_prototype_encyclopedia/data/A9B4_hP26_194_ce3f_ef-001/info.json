    "comments": "(Weston, 1957) determined the space group, lattice constants, and positions of the lead atoms in Na$_{9}$Pb$_{4}$ but were unable to place the sodium atoms.  Using the First-Principles Assisted Structure Solution (FPASS) method, (Ward, 2015) determined a set of positions for the sodium atoms consistent with the available experimental data.  To our knowledge further experimental study of Na$_{9}$Pb$_{4}$ has taken place. \n We have shifted the origin of the $\\hat{z}$ axis by $c/2$ from that chosen by (Weston, 1957), changing the Na-I site from the (2d) Wyckoff position to (2c). \n There is no ICSD entry for this structure, but (Ward, 2015) provide the CIF for this structure in their supplementary material."
