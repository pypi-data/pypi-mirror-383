While we do not have a copy of this paper, we were able to extract the data from the ICSD entry. \n This structure is related to the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A12B_hP13_191_cdei_a-001}{$D2_{a}$ TiBe$_{12}$ structure}.  That structure, however, is probably not the actual TiBe$_{12}$ structure, so we designate HfFe$_{6}$Ge$_{6}$ as the prototype for the ternary form."
