(Xiao, 2019) present a slightly different structure, where all of the sodium atoms are on a (6g) site [ $(x,0,0)$, $x = 0.32$ ], which is 1/3 vacant.  In both cases all of the sodium atoms are near the $z = 0$ and $z = 1/2$ planes. \n We have shifted the origin by 1/2 {\\bf a$_3$} from that of (Viciu, 2007)."
