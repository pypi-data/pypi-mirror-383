    "comments": "(Johansson, 1929) described two possible structures for CuPt.  (Ewald, 1929) and later (Villars, 2007) used the description to determine the space group and atomic positions.  This page describes the rhombohedral structure, which (Ewald, 1929) labeled {\\em Strukturbericht} $L1_{1}$.  The other structure is \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB_cF32_227_c_d-001}{cubic, and was listed as $L1_{3}$}. \n (Barrett, 1980) noted that even slight additions of platinum above stoichiometry will cause a change in the crystal structure. \n \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB_hR2_166_a_b-001}{CuPt} and \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB_hR2_166_a_b-003}{KSH} have the same AFLOW prototype label, AB\\_hR2\\_166\\_a\\_b. They are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files. \n This structure is given in the rhombohedral setting of space group $R\\overline{3}m$ \\#166. The hexagonal setting may be obtained by adding {\\tt --hex} to the aflow command."
