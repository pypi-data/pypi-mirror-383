The S and H atoms form an SH$^{-}$ ion, and so are listed together at the (1b) Wyckoff postition, leading to the listing of this compound in the $B$ {\\em Strukturbericht} category. \n Our original presentation of this structure (Hicks, 2021) inadvertantly used a ``face-centered'' version of this structure.  Here we use original orientation used by (West, 1934). \n \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB_hR2_166_a_b-001}{CuPt ($L1_{1}$)} and \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB_hR2_166_a_b-003}{KSH} have the same AFLOW prototype label, AB\\_hR2\\_166\\_a\\_b. They are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files. \n Hexagonal settings of this structure can be obtained with the option {\\tt --hex}."
