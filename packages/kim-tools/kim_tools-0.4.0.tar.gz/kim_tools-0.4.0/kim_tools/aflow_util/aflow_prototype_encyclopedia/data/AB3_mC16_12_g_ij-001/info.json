(Hermann, 1937) designated this as the \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB3_hP4_164_a_bd-001}{$D0_{13}$ structure}. \n (Ketelaar, 1935) determined that the structure was only pseudo-hexagonal, and place it in space group $C2$ \\#5. (Gottfried, 1937) \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB3_mC16_5_c_3c-001}{designated this as the $D0_{15}$ structure}.  Neither of these works referenced the previous work. \n (Ketelaar, 1947) determined that the space group was actually $C2/m$ ~ \\#12.  Here we present this using the refinement of (Troyanov, 1992)."
