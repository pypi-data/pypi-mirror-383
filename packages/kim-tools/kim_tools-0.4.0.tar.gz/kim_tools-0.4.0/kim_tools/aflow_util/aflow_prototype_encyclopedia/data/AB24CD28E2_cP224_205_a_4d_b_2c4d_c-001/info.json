    "comments": "The alums have the general formula AB(XO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ $\\cdot$ 12H$_{2}$O, where A is a monovalent ion, B is a trivalent ion, and X is a chalcogen.  In most cases atom B is aluminum and atom X is sulfur, leading to the name alum. \n All alums have their room-temperature form in space group $Pa\\overline{3}$ \\#205, but the bonding between the A and B ions and the XO$_{4}$ complex can be quite different. \n (Lipson, 1935ab) described three general forms of alum based on the sizes of the monovalent ions. Each of these forms was given a {\\em Strukturbericht} designation by (Gottfried, 1937): \\begin{itemize} \\item \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB24CD28E2_cP224_205_a_4d_b_2c4d_c-001}{$\\alpha$-alum, with intermediate sized ions, prototype KAl(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ $\\cdot$ 12H$_{2}$O, $H4_{13}$ (this structure)}, \\item \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB2C36D2E20F2_cP252_205_a_c_6d_c_c3d_c-001}{$\\beta$-alum, with large ions, prototype (NH$_{3}$CH$_{3}$)Al(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ $\\cdot$ 12H$_{2}$O, $H4_{14}$}, and \\item \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB24CD20E2_cP192_205_a_4d_b_c3d_c-001}{$\\gamma$-alum, with small ions, prototype NaAl(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ $\\cdot$ 12H$_{2}$O, $H4_{15}$}. \\end{itemize} ~ \\vspace{-.25in} \n This classification scheme is not compete, {\\em e.g.}, (Ledsham, 1968) points out that \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB12CD8E2_cP96_205_a_2d_b_cd_c-001}{NaCr(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ $\\cdot$ 12H$_{2}$O} does not fit into any of these categories, and that the actual structure depends on the combination of monovalent and trivalent ions. \n As noted above, the $Pa\\overline{3}$ structures of alum are the room temperature form.  As the temperature decreases the alum structure may transform.  For example, in the temperature range 150-170K the $\\beta$-alum (NH$_{3}$CH$_{3}$)Al(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ $\\cdot$ 12H$_{2}$O \\href{current_web_home_dir/ABC30DE20F2_oP220_29_a_a_30a_a_20a_2a-001}{transforms into an orthorhombic structure with fully ordered NH$_{3}$CH$_{3}$ ions.} \n (Ewald, 1931) designated the $\\alpha$-alum structure determined by (Cook, 1927) as $H4_{2}$, but when the superior structural determination of (Beevers, 1934) appeared this type was abandoned, and the new structure was given the designation $H4_{13}$. (Nyburg, 2000) were able to determine the positions of the hydrogen atoms, so we use their improved structure as our prototype. \n The oxygen atoms around the sulfur are statistically distributed in two ways: the probability of the O-I and O-III sites being occupied is 78.7\\%, while the probability of the O-II/O-IV combination being occupied is 21.3\\%."
