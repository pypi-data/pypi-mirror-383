    "comments": "The alums have the general formula AB(XO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ $\\cdot$ 12H$_{2}$O, where A is a monovalent ion, B is a trivalent ion, and X is a chalcogen.  In most cases atom B is aluminum and atom X is sulfur, leading to the name alum. \n All alums have their room-temperature form in space group $Pa\\overline{3}$ \\#205, but the bonding between the A and B ions and the XO$_{4}$ complex can be quite different. \n (Lipson, 1935ab) described three general forms of alum based on the sizes of the monovalent ions. Each of these forms was given a {\\em Strukturbericht} designation by (Gottfried, 1937): \\begin{itemize} \\item \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB24CD28E2_cP224_205_a_4d_b_2c4d_c-001}{$\\alpha$-alum, with intermediate sized ions, prototype KAl(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ $\\cdot$ 12H$_{2}$O, $H4_{13}$}, \\item \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB2C36D2E20F2_cP252_205_a_c_6d_c_c3d_c-001}{$\\beta$-alum, with large ions, prototype (NH$_{3}$CH$_{3}$)Al(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ $\\cdot$ 12H$_{2}$O, $H4_{14}$ (this structure)}, and \\item \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB24CD20E2_cP192_205_a_4d_b_c3d_c-001}{$\\gamma$-alum, with small ions, prototype NaAl(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ $\\cdot$ 12H$_{2}$O, $H4_{15}$}. \\end{itemize} ~ \\vspace{-.25in} \n This classification scheme is not compete, {\\em e.g.}, (Ledsham, 1968) points out that \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB12CD8E2_cP96_205_a_2d_b_cd_c-001}{NaCr(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ $\\cdot$ 12H$_{2}$O} does not fit into any of these categories, and that the actual structure depends on the combination of monovalent and trivalent ions. \n As noted above, the $Pa\\overline{3}$ structures of alum are the room temperature form.  As the temperature decreases the alum structure may transform.  For example, in the temperature range 150-170K the $\\beta$-alum (NH$_{3}$CH$_{3}$)Al(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ $\\cdot$ 12H$_{2}$O \\href{current_web_home_dir/ABC30DE20F2_oP220_29_a_a_30a_a_20a_2a-001}{transforms into an orthorhombic structure with fully ordered NH$_{3}$CH$_{3}$ ions.} \n This structure was originally determined by (Lipsom, 1935c), could only determine that the NH$_{3}$CH$_{3}$ ion occupied the (4b) Wyckoff position. (Abdeen, 1981) showed that the ion was statistically distributed at two possible sites.  The C-N bond distance is 1.4{\\AA}, slightly smaller than the 1.51{\\AA} distance observed in the low temperature structure.  At any site, one of the two nitrogen positions is occupied, along with the carbon position 1.4{\\AA} away.  Six hydrogen positions from the (H-I) and (H-II) sites are then occupied."
