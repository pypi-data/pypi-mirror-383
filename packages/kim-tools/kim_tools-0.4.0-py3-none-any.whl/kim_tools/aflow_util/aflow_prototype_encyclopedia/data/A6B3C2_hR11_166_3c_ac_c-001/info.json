See that page for a discussion of our resolution of the problems. \n The ICSD is rather confused about this compound.  The entry associated with (Jeffrey, 1996), \\#41260, has the original structure.  Entry \\#654993 gives a structure quite similar to ours, but it is attributed to (Suzuki, 1993), a paper concerning the structure of iron nitride. It is better associated with (Daams, 1993). We list both ICSDs, but consider \\#654993 the correct structure. \n Hexagonal settings of this structure can be obtained with the option {\\tt --hex}."
