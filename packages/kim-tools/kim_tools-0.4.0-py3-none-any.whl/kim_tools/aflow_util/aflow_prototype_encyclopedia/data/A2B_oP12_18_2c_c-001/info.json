In fact, the structure is in $P2_12_12_1$ \\#19, as an examination of the figures in that paper demonstrate, and shows that $\\gamma$-TeO$_{2}$ takes on the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B_oP12_19_2a_a-002}{$\\beta$-SnF$_{2}$} structure. \n The ICSD entry for (Champarnaud-Mesjard, 2000), 90733, correctly identifies the space group for this structure. \n We regret the error, but leave the structure in place as it has already been published. \n In reality, TeO$_{2}$ has been observed in three different forms (Ceriotti, 2006; Liu, 2016): \\begin{itemize} \\item \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B_tP12_92_b_a-002}{$\\alpha$-TeO$_{2}$, paratellurite} is the ground state \\item \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B_oP24_61_2c_c-002}{$\\beta$-TeO$_{2}$, tellurite} is stable under ambient conditions and is the most commonly observed phase \\item $\\gamma$-TeO$_{2}$ is metastable, and froms at 663K in the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B_oP12_19_2a_a-002}{$\\beta$-SnF$_{2}$} structure. \\end{itemize}"
