At 160~GPa it is predicted to be a conventional superconductor with an approximate transition temperature of 80K, however it is unlikely that this is the crystal structure of the 190K superconductor, which is probably the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A3B_cI8_229_b_a-001}{H$_{3}$S structure} (Bernstein, 2005). \n The data presented here was computed at 170 GPa."
