However, (Gottfried, 1940) used the newer work of (Mooney, 1937) to create a separate {\\em Strukturbericht} designation for NH$_{4}$ClBrI, $F5_{14}$, even though this structure is still obviously related to NH$_{4}$I$_{3}$. \n The positions of the hydrogen atoms in the NH$_{4}$ ions were not determined, so we only provide the positions of the nitrogen atoms (labeled as NH$_{4}$). \n The original structure is given in the $Pmcn$ setting of space group \\#62, which was transformed to the standard $Pnma$ setting by findsym.  However, note that the coordinate transformations for the (4c) Wyckoff positions in (Gottfried, 1940) are erroneous, they give a structure in space group $Pmmn$ \\#59.  (Gottfried, 1937) has the correct tranformations in the $D0_{16}$ section."
