At approximately 2 GPa it transforms to a high-pressure \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B3_oC20_36_b_ab-001}{orthorhombic phase}. \n Originally this phase was thought to be in space group $P3_{1}$ \\#144, but reanalysis by (Effenberger, 2001) showed that the higher symmetry group matches that data at least as well.  For more history on the determination of the structure of B$_{2}$O$_{3}$, see (Prewitt, 1968). \n Space group $P3_{2}21$ \\#154 is the enantiomorph of $P3_{1}21$ \\#152, so the mirror image of this structure could exist in that space group as well."
