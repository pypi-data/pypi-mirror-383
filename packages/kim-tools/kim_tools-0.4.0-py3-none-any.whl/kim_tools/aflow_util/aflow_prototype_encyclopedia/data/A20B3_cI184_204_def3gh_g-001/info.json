Removing this atom transforms this to the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A17B3_cI160_204_def2gh_g-001}{Ru$_{3}$Be$_{17}$ structure}. \n (Armbr\\\"{u}ster, 2000) found that what had previously been thought to be CeCd$_{6}$ was actually \\href{current_web_home_dir/A41B6_cP188_201_b2efg5h_h-001}{Ce$_{6}$Cd$_{37}$}.  This suggests that other XCd$_{6}$ structures may actually have different compositions. \n (Armbr\\\"{u}ster, 2000) also give a structure for CeCd$_{6}$ which differs slightly from the one presented here."
