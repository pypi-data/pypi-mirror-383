We label it Sn. \\item The first (8c) site is pure barium, labeled Ba. \\item The second (8c) site is 76.6\\% gallium and 23.4\\% tin, and is labeled Ga. \\item The (12d) site is 81.60\\% tin and 18.4\\% gallium.  We label this as germanium, Ge, since that is another possible component of this compound and to avoid confusion with the other tin/gallium sites. \\item The (24g) site is 68.6\\% gallium and 31.4\\% tin, and is labeled Sn. \\end{itemize} ~ \\vspace{-.25in} \n The occupation of each of the Sn/Ga sites can be varied during crystal growth, and controls the semiconducting behavior of the sample (Avila, 2006). \n (Aliva, 2008) showed that this compound also exists as \\href{current_web_home_dir/A13B3C8D12_cP72_223_ak_c_i_k-001}{$\\beta$-Ba$_{8}$Ga$_{16}$Sn$_{30}$}, another clathrate structure."
