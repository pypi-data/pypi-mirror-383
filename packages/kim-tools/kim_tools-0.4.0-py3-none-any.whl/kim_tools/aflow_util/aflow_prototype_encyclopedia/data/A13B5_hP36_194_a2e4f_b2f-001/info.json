Using the First-Principles Assisted Structure Solution (FPASS) method, (Ward, 2015) determined a set of positions for the sodium atoms consistent with the available experimental data.  To our knowledge no further experimental study of Na$_{13}$Pb$_{5}$ has taken place. \n There is no ICSD entry for this structure, but (Ward, 2015) provide the CIF for this structure in their supplementary material."
