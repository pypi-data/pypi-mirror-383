Further dehydration in the laboratory produces meta-autunite (II). \n The Calcium site is occupied 50\\% of the time, while 75\\% of the water sites are filled. \n (Beintema, 1938) proposed a structure for meta-autunite (I), which (Herrmann, 1941) designated $H5_{10}$.  He did not locate the calcium and oxygen atoms nor the water molecules.  This structure was improved by (Makarov, 1960), and we include it here as our prototype for $H5_{10}$.  The Ca-I site is 50\\% occupied, while the H2O-I site is 75\\% occupied."
