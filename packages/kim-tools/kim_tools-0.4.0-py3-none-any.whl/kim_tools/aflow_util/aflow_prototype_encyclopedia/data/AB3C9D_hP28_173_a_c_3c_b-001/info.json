(Han, 2018) find a better fit to the data by refining it in the \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB3C9D_hP28_143_2a_2d_6d_bc-001}{trigonal $P3$ \\#143 space group}, which places the lanthanum atoms on two independent crystallographic sites. This may be due to the presence of bismuth impurities on the lantanum site in the (Han, 2018) sample, which contains 3\\% boron, while (Ashtar, 2020) claim to have very pure samples. Given this, we withhold judgment on which structure is correct and present both. \n Space group $P6_3$ does not specify the origin of the $z$-axis.  Here it is set so that the coordinate of the tungsten atom is $z_{2} = 1/4$."
