(Kovnir, 2009) argue that there is actually no inversion site, so the structure is as presented here, in space group $R3m$ \\#160.  The two structures are very close -- if we allow a 0.1{\\AA} uncertainty in the atomic positions the structure becomes $D7_{1}$.  As we already have that structure, we present the Kovnir {\\em et al.} structure here. \n Hexagonal settings of this structure can be obtained with the option {\\tt --hex}."
