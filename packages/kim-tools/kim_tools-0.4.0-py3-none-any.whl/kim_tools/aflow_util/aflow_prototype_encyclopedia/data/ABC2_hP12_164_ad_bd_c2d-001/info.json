According to the phase diagram in (Villars, 2018) this transforms into the \\href{current_web_home_dir/ABC2_hR4_166_a_b_c-009}{rhombohedral $\\alpha$-NaFeO$_{2}$ structure at 365$^\\circ$C}.  (Geller, 1959) agree that this is a high-temperature state, but say that it exists between 120$^\\circ$C and 287$^\\circ$C.  Above this temperature they say that AgBiSe$_{2}$ transforms into the \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB_cF8_225_a_b-001}{NaCl ($B1$) structure, with silver and bismuth randomly placed on the ``Na'' site and selenium on the ``Cl'' site}. \n (Geller, 1959) note that the trigonal ground state and the rhombohedral high-temperature state are very close together, with only small changes in the atomic coordinates needed to transform one into the other. \n The \\href{current_web_home_dir/A4BC7_hP12_164_2d_a_bc2d-001}{MnBi$_{4}$Te$_{7}$ structure} occupies the same Wyckoff positions with a different stoichiometry. The ICSD lists AgBiSe$_{2}$ as the prototype for all of these structures, but we have split them to reflect the chemistry of the structures."
