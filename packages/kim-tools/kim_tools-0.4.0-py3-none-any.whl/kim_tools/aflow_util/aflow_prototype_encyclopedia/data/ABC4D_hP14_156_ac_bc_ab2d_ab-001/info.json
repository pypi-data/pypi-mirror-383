In addition, the origin can be shifted so that (1b) or (1c) atoms are moved to the origin. \n There is no ICSD for the (Okada, 1980) structure of KNaSO$_{4}$, although the ICSD has entries for \\href{current_web_home_dir/A3BC8D2_hP14_164_ad_b_di_d-001}{K$_{3}$Na(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$} from the same paper.  We provide the ICSD entry from the later work of (Filatov, 2019), who named the mineral form belomarinaite. \n Belomarinaite has some mixture of sodium and potassium on the (1a) and (1c) sites that was not reported by (Okada, 1980)."
