    "comments": "This structure has a rather complicated history: \n It is difficult to determine the species of atoms at a given site because of the similar electronic and nuclear cross sections of $^{11}$B and $^{12}$C (Domnich, 2011). \n Early investigations (Clark, 1943) assumed the structure was B$_{4}$C, with the extra carbon atom replacing the boron on the (1b) site. [Note that Clark has an error in the coordinates of one set of boron atoms, giving a boron-boron distance of less that 1{\\AA}.  This error is repeated in (Brandes, 1992) and (Wykcoff, 1964).] \n In reality, concentrations can range from 8-20\\% carbon (Domnich, 2011). \n (Larson, 1986) states that in B$_{13}$C$_{2}$ the (1b) site is boron and as the structure becomes more carbon rich the carbon atoms replace borons in the iscosahedra. We follow this and use the structure determined by (Will, 1976) as our reference. \n (Lazzari, 1999) states that excess electrons go on the ``polar'' sites of the icosahedron, {\\em i.e.} the sites closest to the carbon atoms on the chains (the B III atoms in our notation). \n The original version of this page (Hicks, 2021) listed $a = 6.617$\\AA{} rather than $a = 5.617$\\AA. This has now been corrected."
