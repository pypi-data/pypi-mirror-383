The $F5_{11}$ structure is thus neither \\href{current_web_home_dir/ABC2_mP16_14_e_e_2e-003}{the ground state structure of KNO$_{2}$} nor the room-temperature structure, which is somewhat disordered with space group $R\\overline{3}m$ \\#166. We present this structure as part of the historical record.\n (Ziegler, 1936) gave this structure in the $Am$ setting of space group \\#8.  We used FINDSYM to transform it to the standard $Cm$ setting, which involved a considerable change in the orientation and length of the primitive lattice vectors."
