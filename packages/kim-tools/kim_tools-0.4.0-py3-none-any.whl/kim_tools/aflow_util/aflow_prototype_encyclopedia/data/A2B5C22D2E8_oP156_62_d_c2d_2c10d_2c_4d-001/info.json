    "comments": "(Warren, 1930) analyzed their sample of anthophyllite under the assumption that it was free of iron, and this structure was given the $S4_{4}$ designation by (Hermann, 1937). \n (Walitzi, 1989) found a more accurate determination of the structure, but their sample included substantial amounts of iron.  The Mg-I (4c) site is actually (Mg$_{0.99}$Fe$_{0.01}$), Mg-II (8d) is (Mg$_{0.98}$Fe$_{0.02}$), and Fe (8d) is (Mg$_{0.38}$Fe$_{0.62}$). Trace amounts of calcium, manganese and sodium were found on the magnesium/iron sites, and trace amounts of aluminum were found on the silicon sites. Neither paper was able to determine the positions of the hydrogen atoms, which are included in the OH radicals. \n The ICSD entry for (Walitzi, 1989) does give positions for the hydrogens, but we can not find any evidence of this in the publication. \n Anthophyllite can be thought of as an approximation to a doubled unit cell of \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B7C24D8_oP82_58_g_ae2f_2g5h_2h-001}{protoanthophyllite}, where the hydrogen atoms have been located."
