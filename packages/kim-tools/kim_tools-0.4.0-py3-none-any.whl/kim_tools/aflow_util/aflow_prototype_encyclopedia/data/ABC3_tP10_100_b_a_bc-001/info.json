The isolated nitrogen atoms in this structure's visualization are surrounded by four hydrogen atoms in an approximately tetrahedral arrangement. It is likely that the NH$_{4}$ radicals are free to rotate (Kracek, 1937). \n Both (Shinnaka, 1956) and (Hermann, 1937) state that the available X-ray diffraction data supports a space group of either $P4bm$ \\#100 or $P\\overline{4}2_{1}m$ \\#113.  The atomic positions found by Shinnaka agree with space group $P4bm$. \n (Shinnaka, 1956) states that the NO$_{3}$ nitrate groups are rotating, but this rotation ``is almost bound in two orientations (in opposite directions).'' He then gives two possible orientations for the nitrate.  We present the first orientation here.  The second orientation is obtained by taking $z_{3} \\rightarrow - z_{3}$ and $z_{4} \\rightarrow - z_{4}$. \n Another way of presenting this information would be to add a second nitrate group to the primitive cell, and set the occupation of all the atoms in the nitrates at 50\\%.  This would give a structure in space group $P4/mbm$ \\#127, which might be useful as a pictorial representation but does not correctly represent the physics of the crystal, as the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in an individual nitrate radical must remain together. \n The N--O distances in this structure are about 10\\% smaller than the distances found in the other phases of NH$_{4}$NO$_{3}$.  This suggests that the structure should be reevaluated."
