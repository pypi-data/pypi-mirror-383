We have changed our reference from the original (Dagron, 1969) to the more accessible (Beck, 1986). \n This is a high-pressure phase of GdSI.  At ambient pressure it is in the \\href{current_web_home_dir/ABC_hR6_166_c_c_c-001}{SmSI structure}. \n The ICSD entry for this structure is incomplete, leaving out the (1a), (1d), and (1e) sites, apparently because of a misreading of Table 4 in (Beck, 1968)."
