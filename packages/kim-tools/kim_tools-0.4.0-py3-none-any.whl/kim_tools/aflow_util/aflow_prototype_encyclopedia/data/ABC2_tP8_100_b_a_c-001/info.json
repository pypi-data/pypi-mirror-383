In addition, they were unable to determine the positions of the hydrogen atoms, and it appears that space group $P4bm$ \\#100 is incompatible with having four hydrogen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement about the nitrogen atom.  (Smolentsev, 2005) determined the positions of the hydrogen atoms, and \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB4CD2_tP16_113_c_f_a_e-001}{placed this structure in space group $P\\overline{4}2_{1}m$ \\#113}, making the structure of (Levi, 1931) obsolete.  We present it here for historical interest. \n Since the position of the hydrogen atoms in the NH$_{4}$ ions were not determined, we only provide the nitrogen atom positions (labeled as NH$_{4}$)."
