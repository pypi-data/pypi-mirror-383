Indeed, (Herrman, 1943) formally withdraws this from the {\\em Strukturbericht} list, saying ``The type and description [in (Gottfried, 1937)] should be deleted, as the radiographs were not based on the supposed substance.'' We present it for its historical interest. \n Modern experiments have determined that SbO$_{2}$ appears as \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B_oP24_33_4a_2a-001}{cervantite ($\\alpha$-Sb$_{2}$O$_{4}$)} or \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B_mC24_15_2f_ae-001}{clinocervantite ($\\beta$-Sb$_{2}$O$_{4}$)}."
