The site is reported as fully occupied in InNbS$_{2}$, which is why we and the ICSD choose it as the prototype of the structure, even though (Eppinga, 1980) give it as Tl$_{x}$TaS$_{2}$. \n The value $z_{3}$ = 0.32 for the sulfur (2c) site is inferred from the value given for Ta$_{x}$InSe$_{2}$ by (Eppinga, 1980)."
