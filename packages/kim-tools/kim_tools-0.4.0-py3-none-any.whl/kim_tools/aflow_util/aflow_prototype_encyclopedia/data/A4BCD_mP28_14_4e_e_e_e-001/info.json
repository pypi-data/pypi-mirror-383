(Elema, 1963)  The correct structure is essentially the same as Mooney's with water molecules added into the vacancies, and we use KICl$_{4}$$\\cdot$H$_{2}$O as our prototype for $H0_{10}$.  To return to Mooney's structure, remove the water molecules, but of course this will not be a stable structure. \n The Wyckoff positions given by both (Mooney, 1938) and (Elema, 1963) are in the $P2_1/n$ setting of space group \\#14.  We have used FINDSYM to translate this to the standard $P2_1/c$ setting."
