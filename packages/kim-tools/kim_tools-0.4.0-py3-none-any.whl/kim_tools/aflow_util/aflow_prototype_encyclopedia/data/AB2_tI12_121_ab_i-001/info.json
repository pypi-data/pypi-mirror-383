However, even then it was recognized that changing $z_{3}$ from the value of 0.2 assigned by Wever to 1/4 would add an inversion symmetry to the crystal, change the space group to $I4/mcm$ \\#140, and make the structure look very much like \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B_tI12_140_h_a-001}{Al$_{2}$Cu, {\\em Strukturbericht} $C16$}. This has become the accepted structure, as in (Kapfenberger, 2006), so the label $C17$ is depreciated.  We retain it here for historical interest."
