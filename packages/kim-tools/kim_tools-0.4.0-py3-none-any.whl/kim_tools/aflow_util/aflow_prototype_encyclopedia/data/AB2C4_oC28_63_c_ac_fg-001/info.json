Subsequently (Niggli, 1954) rather acerbically pointed out that Miller's coordinates were consistent with the more compact $Cmcm$ \\#63 space group.  This does not change the positions of the atoms in the conventional cell, so we use the compact structure as our prototype for {\\em Strukturbericht} designation $H1_{8}$. \n This structure is stable up to 413$^{\\circ}$C.
