    "comments": "(Gottfried, 1937) gave this the {\\em Strukturbericht} designation $H4_{7}$.  They listed the system as monoclinic, with space group $C2$ \\#5, but noted that it was pseudo-hexagonal and gave the coordinates for the all of the atoms except the water molecules in terms of the trigonal space group $P3_{1}21$ \\#152.  (Abriel, 1993) found a complete determination of the structure in space group $I2$ \\#5, which we have converted to the standard $C2$ setting. The structure of this system seems to depend on the actual amount of water and the preparation mechanism, as there are both $\\alpha$- and $\\beta$- forms which have different strengths but similar crystal structures (Singh, 2007). \n The $P3_{1}21$ structure can be obtained from these positions by removing all of the water molecules (the hydrogen atoms plus O-I and O-XIV, and allowing for a small uncertainty in the positions of the remaining atoms. \n The ICSD entry only describes the $P3_{1}21$ structure."
