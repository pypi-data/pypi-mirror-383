Their unit cell is three times larger than the standard cell for this structure, and is now considered erroneous. (Abrahams, 2008). \\item (B\\\"{u}hrer, 1977) placed it in \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B_hP6_187_gi_ad-001}{hexagonal space group $P\\overline{6}m2$ \\#187}, with the copper atoms partially occupying two sites. \\item (Sakuma, 1988) placed it in \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB_hP4_156_ab_ab-001}{trigonal space group $P3m1$ \\#156} with a smaller unit cell than (Kurdyumova, 1961) and no disorder on the copper sites. \\item (Keen, 1994) placed it in \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B_hP6_164_2d_d-001}{trigonal space group $P\\overline{3}m1$ \\#164} (this structure), with a unit cell similar to (B\\\"{u}hrer, 1977) and (Sakuma, 1988).  Like the former paper, the oxygen positions are disordered. \\end{itemize} \\end{itemize} ~ \\vspace{-.25in} \n The data from (Keen, 1994) was taken at 655K.  \n The copper sites are only partially occupied:  Cu-I (2d) is 85.1\\% filled, with the remaining 14.9\\% of the copper atoms going on the Cu-II (2d) site."
