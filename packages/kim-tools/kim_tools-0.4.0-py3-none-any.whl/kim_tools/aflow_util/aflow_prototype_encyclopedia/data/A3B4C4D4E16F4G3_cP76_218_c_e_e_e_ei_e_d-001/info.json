    "comments": "(Gottfried, 1937) used the work of (Machatschki, 1934) for {\\em Strukturbericht} label $S6_{9}$.  We have used the updated 153K data of (Hassan, 1991). \n (Machatschki, 1934) puts the sodium, calcium, and potassium atoms at the same (8e) Wyckoff position, with partial occupancies of approximately Na$_{0.75}$Ca$_{0.25}$ and a trace of calcium.  The sample studied by (Hassan, 1991) was found to have the three atoms at slightly different (8e) positions, with 54\\% sodium occupation, 30\\% calcium occupation, and 20\\% potassium occupation. \n (Machatschki, 1934) put the sulfur atom at the origin, Wyckoff position (2a), and assumed that there were two SO$_{4}$ molecules per formula unit.  (Hassan, 1991) found that there were statistically only 1.5 molecules per formula unit, and that the sulfur atom was slightly displaced from the origin to a (8e) site, where each atomic position was occupied only 19\\% of the time.  The corresponding (8e) oxygen site (O-I in our notation, O2 in Hassan) is only occupied 75\\% of the time to maintain the SO$_{4}$ stoichiometry. \n We shifted the origin of (Hassan, 1991) so that the resulting atomic positions are close to those reported by (Machatschki, 1934). The later structure can be recovered from the former by moving all of the sodium, calcium, and potassium atoms to the same Wyckoff position, moving the sulfur atom to the origin, Wyckoff position (2a), and adjusting the occupation of each site appropriately. \n The 153K data presented in (Downs, 2003) has errors in the $z$ coordinates of the CaC$_{2}$ (our Ca) and O2 (our O-I) atoms.  In both cases, the $z$ coordinate should be the same as the $x$ and $y$ coordinates. \n The AFLOW label models the structure as if the sites were fully occupied."
