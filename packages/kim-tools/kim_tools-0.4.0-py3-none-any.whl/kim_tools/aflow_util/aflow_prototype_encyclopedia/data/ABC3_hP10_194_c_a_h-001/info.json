The structures are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files. \n Note that the ICSD entry for this structure places the barium atom on the (2d) site rather than the (2c) site as given by (Lander, 1951).  This results in a rather profound difference in the structure."
