    "comments": "(Mark, 1925) studied a variety of B$_{2}$H$_{6}$ structures, including the one given {\\em Strukturbericht} designation $D4_{1}$ by (Ewald,1931). (Smith, 1965) refined this structure, including the hydrogen positions. \n (Smith, 1965) presented the crystallographic information for this structure in the $P2_{1}/n$, unique axis-c, setting of space group \\#14.  We used FINDSYM to put the information into the standard $P2_{1}/c$, unique axis b, setting.  This involved modifications of the primitive vectors beyond a simple rotation. \n This structure shares the same AFLOW designation, AB3\\_mP16\\_14\\_e\\_3e, as the \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB3_mP16_14_e_3e-002}{B$_{2}$H$_{6}$ structure defined by (Yao, 2011)},which is probably what was called $D4_{1}$.  The structures differ in the orientation and placement of the molecules. They are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files."
