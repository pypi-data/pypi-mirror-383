If we wish to include these in a the form favored by this paper, the composition is better listed as O$_{3}$[Ti$_{6}$F$_{27}$(H$_{3}$O)$_{3}$]$_{2}$. \n (Shylyapnikov, 2018) state that ``Hydrogen atoms in the structures of [H$_{3}$O]$_{3}$[Ti$_{6}$F$_{27}$] \\dots were placed on ideal positions and refined as riding atoms with relative isotropic displacement parameters.''  This places the hydrogen atoms 0.91{\\AA} from the associated oxygen."
