    "comments": "(Ito, 1934)'s original determination of the epididymite structure, designated as $S4_{7}$ by (Gottfried, 1937), was flawed, even in the author's estimation.  In particular, both the Si-O and Si-Be distances are very small, with Si-Be less than 1{\\AA}. \n Ito and many later authors assumed that the hydrogen atoms formed OH radicals, but (Gatta, 2008) found that the hydrogen atoms were actually a part of a water molecule. \n Since the (Ito, 1934) structure is not even suitable for starting first-principles calculations and the (Gatta, 2008) structure maintains the $Pnma$ \\#62 space group, we have dropped the former and designate the later as $S4_{7}$. \n Epididymite and its diomorph, \\href{current_web_home_dir/A2B4C2D17E6_mC124_15_f_2f_f_e8f_3f-001}{eudidymite}, are two forms of hydrated sodium beryllium silicate which are stable under ambient conditions.
