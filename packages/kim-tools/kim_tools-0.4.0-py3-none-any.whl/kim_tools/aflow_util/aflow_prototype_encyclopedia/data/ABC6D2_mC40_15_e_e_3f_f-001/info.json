    "comments": "Named for University of Michigan geologist Eric Essene (1939-2010). (Cosca, 1987) gives the composition as (Ca$_{0.97}$Fe$_{0.03}$)(Fe$_{0.58}$Al$_{0.42}$)(Si$_{0.54}$Al$_{0.46}$)$_{2}$O$_{6}$. We will use the majority atom at each site to draw the structure. \n Esseneite is one of the class of ``clinopyroxene'' materials, composition XYSi$_{2}$O$_{6}$, where in general X is an alkaline or alkaline earth metal and Y is a transition metal.  In addition, the silicon may be partially or wholly replaced by another element.  Clinopyroxenes are in the space group $C2/c$ \\#15, distinguishing them from \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB3C_oP80_61_2c_6c_2c-001}{orthopyroxenes, which are in space group $Pbca$ \\#61} and the atoms X and Y are both small radius cations. Most of the structures listed are stable at room temperature and above. \n This structure has the same AFLOW label, ABC6D2\\_mC40\\_15\\_e\\_e\\_3f\\_f, as \\href{current_web_home_dir/ABC6D2_mC40_15_e_e_3f_f-002}{diopside (CaMg(SiO$_{3}$)$_{2}$, $S4_{1}$)}. The structures are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files."
