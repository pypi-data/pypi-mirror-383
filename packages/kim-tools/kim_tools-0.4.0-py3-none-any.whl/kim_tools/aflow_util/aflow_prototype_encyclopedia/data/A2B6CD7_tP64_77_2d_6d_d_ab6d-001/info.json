This is not the case for the $z$-coordinates and the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of the hydrogen atoms: those coordinates should be multiplied by $10^{-3}$.  This confusion led to incorrect hydrogen-oxygen distances in both our original page (Hicks, 2019) and in (Villars, 2016).  We believe the current interpretation is correct, as our Mg-O and B-O distances agree with (Genkina, 1983) and all of our O-H bonds are on the order of 1{\\AA}. The ICSD CIF also interprets the coordinates in this fashion."
