    "comments": "Pb$_{3}$O$_{4}$ has been observed in several structures (Wriedt, 1988; Dinnebier, 2003): \\begin{itemize} \\item Below 170K (Wriedt, 1988) it is in the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A4B3_oP28_55_ghi_egh-001}{orthorhombic Minium-R structure}.  (Gavarri, 1978) tracks this structure up to 240K. \\item Above 170K it is in the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A4B3_tP28_135_gh_dh-002}{tetragonal Minium-T structure}. \\item At ambient temperature the Minium-T structure transforms into what is apparently the Minium-R structure at a pressure between 0.11 and 0.3 GPa. (Dinnebier, 2003) call this {\\em Phase II}. \\item If the pressure is increased, between 5.54 and 6.6 GPa the structure transforms into orthorhombic \\href{current_web_home_dir/A4B3_oP14_55_gh_ah-001}{Phase III structure} (this structure). \\end{itemize} ~ \\vspace{-0.25in} \n We use the data taken at 13.3GPa and 295K. (Dinnebier, 2003) give the coordinates of the Pb I atom as (1/2 1/2 0).  This is a (4e) Wyckoff position and makes the stoichiometry of the structure Pb$_{4}$O$_{4}$.  The ICSD entry corrects this to (0 1/2 0), the (2c) site.  We use this, however AFLOW shifts the origin, moving the (2c) atoms to the (2a) site. Unfortunately, the resulting configuration of the lead atoms does not match that shown in Figure 5(c) of the paper.  We have no resolution of this, so we have marked the structure as possible."
