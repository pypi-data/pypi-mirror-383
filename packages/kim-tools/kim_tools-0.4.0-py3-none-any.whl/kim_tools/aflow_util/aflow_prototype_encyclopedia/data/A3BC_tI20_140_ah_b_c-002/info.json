    "comments": "As with most perovskites, SrZrO$_{3}$ undergoes a number of phase transitions.  The temperature-driven phase transitions are summarized by (Kumar, 2017). \n We have arbitrarily labeled the phases from low- to high-temperature by Greek letters. \\begin{itemize} \\item Below 970K $\\alpha$-SrZrO$_{3}$ is in the \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB3C_oP20_62_c_cd_a-001}{orthorhombic CaTiO$_{3}$ ($Pnma$) structure}. \\item In the range 970-1100K, the system is in either the \\begin{itemize} \\item Base-centered orthorhombic $\\beta$-SrZrO$_{3}$ phase in the \\href{current_web_home_dir/ABC3_oC40_63_2c_d_efg-001}{$Cmcm$ lueshite structure}, or \\item The body-centered orthorhombic $\\beta$'-SrZrO$_{3}$ phase in the \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB3C_oI20_74_e_eg_a-001}{orthorhombic BaPbO$_{3}$ structure}. \\end{itemize} The former phase seems to be favored by experiment, but it does not share any subgroups with the $Pnma$ structure, so a direct phase transition is difficult. On the other hand the later structure does not show up in the experimental results in the ICSD, only in a theoretical calculation (ICSD 89356) by (Liu, 2012). (Kumar, 2017) mostly favor the first option, while (Fujimori, 2004) favor the second, albeit with no experimental data for the $Imma$ phase. \\item Between 1100-1440K the system is in the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A3BC_tI20_140_ah_b_c-002}{tetragonal $\\gamma$-SrZrO$_{3}$ phase}. (this structure) \\item Above 1440K the system is in the \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB3C_cP5_221_a_c_b-001}{cubic perovskite phase ($E2_{1}$)}. \\end{itemize} ~ \\vspace{-0.25in} \n Here we use the data taken by (Kennedy, 1999) at 1023K. \n The current structure can be a high-temperature ({\\em e.g.} SrZrO$_{3}$) or high-pressure (BaIrO$_{3}$) phase, depending on the compound. \n We attempted to list the chemical formulas for the similar structures in the form ABC$_{3}$, where ``A'' is the (4b) Wyckoff position, (corresponding to the Ca site in cubic perovskite), ``B'' (4c) (Ti site) and ``C'' is (4a)\\&(8h) (the oxygen site). \n In addition, both the ``A'' (4b) and ``B'' (4c) sites are often alloyed, and even the (4a) and (8h) sites can be a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen."
