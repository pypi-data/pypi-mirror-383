We use the lattice constants from (Magn\\'{e}li, 1949) for K$_{0.57}$WO$_{3}$. \n Magn\\'{e}li's X-ray data could not determine the oxygen positions. The coordinates for the oxygen atoms were determined by the requirement that the space group be $P4/mbm$ \\#127. as determined by the positions of the potassium and tungsten atoms, and by ``considerations of space.''"
