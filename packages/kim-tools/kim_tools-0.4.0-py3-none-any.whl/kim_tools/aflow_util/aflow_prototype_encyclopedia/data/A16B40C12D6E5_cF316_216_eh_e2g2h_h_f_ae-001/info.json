The ``nominal'' composition is given as F$_{16}$O$_{40}$Ti$_{12}$Y$_{6}$Zn$_{5}$ by (Ercit, 1995), but as the CIF in (Downs, 2003) shows, even these labels are not quite correct.  In our listing we label each Wyckoff position by the type of atom that has the largest concentration on that site.  Following (Downs, 2003): \\begin{itemize} \\item Site Zn-I has the composition Zn$_{0.89}$Si$_{0.11}$. \\item Site F-I has the composition F$_{0.55}$O$_{0.45}$. \\item Site O-I is pure oxygen. \\item Site Zn-II has the composition Zn$_{0.48}$Fe$_{0.25}$Na$_{0.16}$Ti$_{0.11}$. \\item Site Y has the composition Y$_{0.37}$Na$_{0.35}$Mn$_{0.03}$HREE$_{0.25}$, where ``HREE'' is a mixture of heavy Rare Earth elements. \\item Site O-II is pure oxygen, but only 8.3333\\% of the sites are occupied. \\item Site O-III has the composition O$_{0.7}$F$_{0.3}$. \\item Site O-IV is pure oxygen. \\item Site O-V is pure oxygen, but only 87\\% of the sites are occupied. \\item Site F-II is pure fluorine, but only 33.333\\% of the sites are occupied. \\item Site Ti has the composition Ti$_{0.76}$Nb$_{0.13}$Na$_{0.11}$. \\end{itemize}"
