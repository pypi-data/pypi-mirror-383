However, (Carrillo-Cabrera, 1983) showed that the structure actually reduces to space group $Cmcm$ \\#63, and this was recognized by (Parth\\'{e}, 1993).  We follow that latter two works and assign the $D0_e$ structure to space group $Cmcm$. \n (Carrillo-Cabrera, 1983) placed the structure in setting $Bmmb$ of space group \\#63, but we have shifted it to the standard $Cmcm$ setting. \n \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB3_oC16_63_c_3c-001}{Mn$_{3}$As ($D0_{d}$)} and \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB3_oC16_63_c_3c-002}{NdTe$_{3}$} have the same AFLOW prototype label, AB3\\_oC16\\_63\\_c\\_3c. They are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files."
