We follow (Matsunaga, 2004) and label the first (2c) site as Sb with the other two Te, preserving the stiochiometry. \n The binary form of this structure is \\href{current_web_home_dir/A3B4_hR7_166_ac_2c-002}{Sn$_{4}$P$_{3}$}. \n Hexagonal settings of this structure can be obtained with the option {\\tt --hex}."
