He could not locate the oxygen atoms, and so was unable to give an unequivocal determination of the space group, beyond noting that it was rhombohedral.  We use the modern structure of (Jacobs, 2000), which agrees with Wyckoff in the positioning of the potassium and tin atoms and finds both the hydrogen and oxygen locations. \n (Ewald, 1931) gave this the {\\em Strukturbericht} designation $H6_{2}$.  (Hermann, 1937) began relabeling the $H6$ structures as $I1$, and (Gottfried, 1937) relabeled them as $J1$, but neither they nor successor volumes revisited this structure, so it was never formally relabeled $J1_{2}$.  We will therefore leave it as $H6_{2}$. \n Hexagonal settings for rhombohedral structures can be obtained with the option {\\tt --hex}."
