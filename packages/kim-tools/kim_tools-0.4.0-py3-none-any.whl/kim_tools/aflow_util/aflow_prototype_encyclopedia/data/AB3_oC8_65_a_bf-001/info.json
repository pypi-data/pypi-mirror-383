(Hart, 2009) has a review of these calculations. It was originally given the $L1_{3}$ designation. As this has been frequently used in the literature ({\\em e.g.} Mehl, 2017), we will continue to used it despite the possible confusion. \n Data for this structure comes from the supplemental material of (Hart, 2013)."
