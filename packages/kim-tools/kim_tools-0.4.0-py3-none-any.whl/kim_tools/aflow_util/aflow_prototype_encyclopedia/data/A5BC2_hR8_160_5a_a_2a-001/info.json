The iron atoms may also be replaced by nickel. \n (Stahl, 2018) found that the germanium atoms actually half-fill two sites, one with $z = 0.48493$ and the other with $z = 0.50663$.  In the diagram these two sites will overlap, so we replaced them by a single averaged site. \n Hexagonal settings of this structure can be obtained with the option {\\tt --hex}."
