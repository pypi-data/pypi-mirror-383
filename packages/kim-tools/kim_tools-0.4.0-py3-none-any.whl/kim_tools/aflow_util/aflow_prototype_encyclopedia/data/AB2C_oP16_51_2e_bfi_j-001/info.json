This state is apparently metastable. (this structure) \\end{itemize} ~ \\vspace{-.25in} \n (\\v{D}urovi\\v{c}, 1961) found that Kenhsuite was composed of blocks of periodic structure in space group $C2/m$ \\#12, with lattice constants $(a',b',c') = (2a,2b,c)$, where $(a,b,c)$ are the lattice constants given here.  This page shows what \\v{D}urovi\\v{c} refers to as the ``composite structure,'' essentially averaging all of the periodic structures.  The data for this structure was originally given in the $Pbmm$ setting of space group \\#51.  We used FINDSYM to transform it to the standard $Pmma$ setting, which involved a rotation and a translation. \n The Hg-III (4i) site is only half occupied, giving the observed stoichiometry."
