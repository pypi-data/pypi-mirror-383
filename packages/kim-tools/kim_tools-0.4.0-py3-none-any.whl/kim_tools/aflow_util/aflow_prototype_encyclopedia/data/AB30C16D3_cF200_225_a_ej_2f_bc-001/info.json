This structure was designated $H71$ ($H7_{1}$) by (Ewald, 1931), renamed $I2_{1}$ by (Hermann, 1937) and finally changed to $J2_{1}$ by (Gottfried, 1937). \n The structure determined by (Udovenko, 2003) found that the fluorine atoms are split onto two sites: \n F-I, at Wyckoff position (24e) is 1/3 filled, and \n F-II, at (96j), is 1/6 filled. \n The positions are so close that a reasonable approximation can be made by eliminating the (96j) site and fully occupying the (24e) site. \n The H-I (32f) site is fully occupied, while the H-II (32f) site is 50\\% occupied. \n Our original description of the structure (Hicks, 2021) incorrectly used a value of $1/2-x_{5}$ for the position of the H I atom.  This rotated the NH$_{4}$ ions by $90^{\\circ}$ about the $z$-axis from their correct orientation.  The currect CIF has the correct value for $x_{5}$."
