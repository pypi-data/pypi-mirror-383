This is the only ICSD report of a compound occupying the first three Wyckoff positions of space group $P6_{3}/mmc$ \\#194. \n (Gaoke, 2006) refer to this as SrCoO$_{x}$, but the reported structure is stochiometric SrCoO. The Co-O distance is only 1.05{\\AA}, so this structure may not be entirely correct."
