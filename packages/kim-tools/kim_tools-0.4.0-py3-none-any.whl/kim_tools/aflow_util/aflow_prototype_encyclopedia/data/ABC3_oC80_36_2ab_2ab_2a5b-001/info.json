It is unclear to us which structure is correct, so we present both. However, we do note that if we allow some uncertainity in the atoms of this structure, the findsym code shows it to be identical to Structure I.\n On heating, $\\alpha$-KNO$_{3}$  transforms into \\href{current_web_home_dir/ABC6_hR8_166_a_b_h-001}{$\\beta$-KNO$_{3}$ at 128$^\\circ$C}.  When heated above 200$^\\circ$C and then cooled, the $\\beta$ phase transforms into the metastable ferroelectric \\href{current_web_home_dir/ABC3_hR5_160_a_a_b-002}{$\\gamma$-KNO$_{3}$ phase}, which remains metastable at room temperature."
