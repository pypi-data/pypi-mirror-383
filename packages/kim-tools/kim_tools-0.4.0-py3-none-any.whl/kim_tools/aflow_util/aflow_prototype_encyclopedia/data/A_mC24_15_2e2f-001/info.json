    "comments": "This structure was determined by density functional simulations. The authors claim it is in good agreement with experimental data for H-III, and is the lowest energy structure at pressures from approximately 100-250 GPa, including zero-point motion. The data presented here was computed at 300 GPa. If we change our description of the unit cell so that $\\mathbf{a}_{3} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{a}_{1}+\\mathbf{a}_{2}+\\mathbf{a}_{3}$  then all of the primitive vectors for the base-centered orthorhombic structure have approximately equal lengths, and the angles between them are approximately 60$^\\circ$. This structure is very close to exhibiting a face-centered cubic lattice."
