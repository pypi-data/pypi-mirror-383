    "comments": "We use the structure proposed by (Kamb, 1960), a refinement of the original (Pauling, 1933) $S0_{8}$ structure. The only major difference is the $y$ coordinate of the OH/F-I site, which is now at a more reasonable distance from the chlorine atom.\n For easy of visualization, we have used fluorine atoms to represent all of the (OH,F)$_{18}$ positions, but in reality the system is dominated by OH, not F.  Kamb argues that the physics of hydrogen bonding makes it likely that the actual structure has composition (OH)$_{16}$F$_{2}$, with the fluorine atoms substituting for OH on the second (48h) site."
