This work did not find the positions of the hydrogen atoms, which we take from (Hill, 1979) and which do not change the space group. \n Hill gave the Wyckoff positions of the atoms in terms of the $Pbnm$ setting of space group \\#62.  We used AFLOW to transform this structure to the standard $Pnma$ setting. Our earlier transformation (Hicks, 2009) had errors which we correct here. \n This structure has the same AFLOW label as \\href{current_web_home_dir/ABC2_oP16_62_c_c_2c-003}{CaMnSb$_{2}$}, ABC2\\_oP16\\_62\\_c\\_c\\_2c. The structures are generated by the same symmetry operations with different sets of parameters ({\\tt --params}) specified in their corresponding CIF files."
