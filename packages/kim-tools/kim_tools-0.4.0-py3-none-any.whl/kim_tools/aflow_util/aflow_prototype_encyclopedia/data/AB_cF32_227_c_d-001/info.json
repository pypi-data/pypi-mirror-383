    "comments": "(Johansson, 1929) described two possible structures for CuPt.  (Ewald, 1929) and later (Villars, 2007) used the description to determine the space group and atomic positions.  This page describes the cubic structure, which (Ewald, 1929) labeled {\\em Strukturbericht} $L1_{1}$.  The other structure is \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB_hR2_166_a_b-001}{rhombohedral}, and was listed as $L1_{1}$. (Villars, 2007) prefers the later structure, listing the current one as ``superceded.'' \n (Barrett, 1980) noted that even slight additions of platinum above stoichiometry will cause a change in the crystal structure. \n This structure is equivalent to the $D4$ structure of (Lu, 1991). \n It should not be confused with the \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB3_oC8_65_a_bf-001}{CuPt$_{3}$ structure, which has also been given the $L1_{3}$ label}, and which we will often refer to as $L1_{3}(II)$."
