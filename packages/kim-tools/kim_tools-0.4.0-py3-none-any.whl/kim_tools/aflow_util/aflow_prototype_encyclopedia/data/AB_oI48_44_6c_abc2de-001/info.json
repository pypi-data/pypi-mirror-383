    "comments": "It is rather a mystery why (Hermann, 1937) gave this the {\\em Strukturbericht} designation $B30$, as the structure presented in the literature contradicts itself.  (Tarschish, 1933) derived this structure from the hexagonal Laves structure \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB2_hP12_194_f_ah-001}{MgZn$_{2}$ (C14)} by doubling the unit cell in all directions to obtain a 96 atom unit cell, replacing 16 of the zinc atoms in this structure by magnesium, and shifting the $z$-coordinates of these atoms by $\\pm c/16$.  He then states that the space group remains $P6_{3}/mmc$ \\#194. \n (McKeehan, 1935) pointed out that this is impossible, as the converted Mg atoms only have a two-fold rotation axis about the $z$-axis.  He assigned the structure to space group $Pmm2$ \\#25. \n (Hermann, 1937) referenced both papers, giving the space group as $P6_{3}/mmc$ but listing the atomic coordinates enumerated by McKeehan. \n In fact, the McKeehan structure has space group $Imm2$ \\#44, with 48 atoms in the conventional cell, half of the original, and 24 atoms in the primitive cell.  This was noted, without reference, by (Parth\\'{e}, 1993), which is the only comprehensive list of {\\em Strukturbericht} symbols to include the $B30$ structure. We have reproduced this $Imm2$ structure from McKeehan's data. \n The true structure of MgZn is unclear. It is seen in the Mg-Zn binary phase diagram (Massalski, 1990) over a small range of compositions, but a complete crystallographic study has never been published.  It is possible that the actual structure is off-stoichiometry. There is some evidence of an Mg$_{12}$Zn$_{13}$ structure (Mezbahul-Islam, 2014), and Mg$_{21}$Zn$_{25}$ has been determined (Cern\\'{y}, 2002) to have the \\href{current_web_home_dir/A25B21_hR92_167_b2e3f_e3f-001}{Zr$_{21}$Re$_{25}$ structure}. \n There are similar problems with the \\href{current_web_home_dir/AB5_mC48_12_2i_ac5i2j-001}{$D2_{2}$ MgZn$_{5}$ structure}, which we discuss on that page. \n The ICSD entry is from (Tarschish, 1933).  It gives the atomic positions in space group $P1$ \\#1, but AFLOW finds that the structure is in space group $Imm2$ \\#44, as found from our analysis of (McKeehan, 1935). Unsurprisingly, this structure does not agree with our interpretation of the data."
