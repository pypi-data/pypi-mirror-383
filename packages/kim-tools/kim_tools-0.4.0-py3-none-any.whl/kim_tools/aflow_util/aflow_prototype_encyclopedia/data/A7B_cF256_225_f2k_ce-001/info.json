There is considerable disorder here.  The site we labeled Cu-II is occupied 33\\% of the time with a mixture of copper and iron atoms.  The Cu-I and Cu-III sites are occupied 31\\% and 7\\% of the time, respectively, and are purely copper.  The sulfur atoms form a nearly cubic fcc lattice, with one of the tetrahedral sites is occupied by a copper or iron atom, and the other site is either filled by a copper atom or remains vacant.
