## Adam-atan2 - Pytorch

Implementation of the proposed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05872">Adam-atan2</a> optimizer in Pytorch

A multi-million dollar paper out of google deepmind proposes a small change to Adam update rule (using `atan2`) to remove the epsilon altogether for numerical stability and scale invariance

It also contains some features for improving plasticity (continual learning field)

## Install

```bash
$ pip install adam-atan2-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from torch import nn

# toy model

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)

# import AdamAtan2 and instantiate with parameters

from adam_atan2_pytorch import AdamAtan2

opt = AdamAtan2(model.parameters(), lr = 1e-4)

# forward and backwards

for _ in range(100):
  loss = model(torch.randn(10))
  loss.backward()

  # optimizer step

  opt.step()
  opt.zero_grad()
```
