Redirect pages using meta http-equiv tags

## Installation

This plugin can be installed via:

```shell
python -m pip install pelican-redirect
```

After the plugin is installed via pip, add `pelican_redirect` to your `PLUGINS` list in pelicanconf.py
```shell
PLUGINS = ['pelican_redirect', ...]
```

## Usage

Once this plugin is installed, you can add a key to the frontmatter of the file called `original_url`. The plugin will generate an HTML page at that location that redirects to the new location of the post/page. Example:

```markdown
Title: A sample title
original_url: blog-posts/2021/07/21/a-sample-title.html

Content here
```

Assuming this file is now going to be served from `blog-posts/a-simple-title.html`, a file will be written to `blog-posts/2021/07/21/a-sample-title.html` that redirects to the new URL.

If `original_url` does not have a file extension, or the file extension is something other than `.htm` or `.html`, then `original_url` is assumed to be a directory and `index.html` is appended to the URL.

## Bulk Usage

To perform a page-wide redirect, you can use the `CONTENT_REDIRECT_CONFIGURATION` setting, which allows you to configure an original URL using page metadata. The structure of this configuration key looks like so:

```python
CONTENT_REDIRECT_CONFIGURATION = [
    {
        "ARTICLE_URL": "old/layout/{slug}.html",
        "PAGE_URL": "old/pages/{slug}.html",
    }
]
```

For any entry in that list, if there is no key for the content type (for example, one configuration may only have `ARTICLE_URL`, another might only have `PAGE_URL`), the redirect will only be generated for the keys that are specified and the others will be skipped.
