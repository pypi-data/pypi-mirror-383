"""
InforCOM ETL Configuration Models.

This module defines Pydantic models for configuring the InforCOM ETL pipeline.
These models provide type safety, validation, and structure for pipeline configuration,
including table-specific settings and overall pipeline control.

The models support:
- Table-level configuration with GUID tracking and activation flags
- Pipeline-wide configuration with phase control (extract/transform/load)
- Flexible configuration with additional fields support
- Version tracking for configuration compatibility
