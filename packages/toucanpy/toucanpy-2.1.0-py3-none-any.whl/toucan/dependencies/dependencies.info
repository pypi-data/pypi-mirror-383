Aapt
====
Aapt is a Python wrapper around the aapt tool, which can be used to analyze APK files.
We found this tool here: https://github.com/HuMoran/aapt
We use this to check the version of an apk file.
Installing this through pip didn't work, which is why we include it this way.
Also we made a small change because the tool didn't work when called from a different working directory.
