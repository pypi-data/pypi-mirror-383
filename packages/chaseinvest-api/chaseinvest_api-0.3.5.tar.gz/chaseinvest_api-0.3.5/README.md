# chaseinvest-api
 A reverse-engineered python API to interact with the Chase Trading platform.

 This is not an official api! This api's functionality may change at any time.

 This api provides a means of buying and selling stocks through Chase. It uses playwright to scrape response data and to interact with the website.

## Contribution
I am new to coding and new to open-source. I would love any help and suggestions!

## Disclaimer
I am not a financial advisor and not affiliated with Chase in any way. Use this tool at your own risk. I am not responsible for any losses or damages you may incur by using this project. This tool is provided as-is with no warranty.

## Setup
Install using pypi:
```
pip install chaseinvest-api
```
This package requires playwright. After installing chaseinvest-api, you will need to finish the install of playwright. You can do this in most cases by running the command:
```
playwright install
```
If you would like some more information on this, you can find it [here](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro).

## Quickstart
The code below will: 
- Login and print account info. 
- Get a quote for 'INTC' and print out the information
- Place a market order for 'INTC' on the first account in the `account_numbers` list
- Print out the order confirmation

```python
import sys

from chase import account as acc
from chase import order as och
from chase import session
from chase import symbols as sym

# create Session Headless does not work at the moment it must be set to false.
cs = session.ChaseSession(title="Title of your profile here", headless=False, profile_path='your/profile/path')

# Login to Chase.com
login_one = cs.login("your_username", "your_password", "last_four_of_your_cell_phone")

# Check if login succeeded without needing 2fa if not then prompt for 2fa code
if login_one == False:
    print('Login succeeded without needing 2fa...')
else:
    code = input('Please input code that was sent to your phone: ')
    login_two = cs.login_two(code)

# Make all account object
all_accounts = acc.AllAccount(cs)

if all_accounts.account_connectors is None:
    sys.exit("Failed to get account connectors exiting script...")

# Get Account Identifiers
print("====================================")

        print(
            f"Order Number: {order_number} Side: {order_type} Status: {order_status_code}"
        )
print("====================================")

# Get quote for INTC

print("====================================")
print("SYMBOL QUOTE")
print(
    f"{symbol_quote.security_description} ask price {symbol_quote.ask_price}, @{symbol_quote.as_of_time} and the last trade was {symbol_quote.last_trade_price}."
)
print("====================================")

    account_ids[0],
    1,
    och.PriceType.MARKET,

    och.Duration.DAY,
    och.OrderSide.BUY,
    dry_run=True,

if messages["ORDER CONFIRMATION"] != "":
    print(messages["ORDER CONFIRMATION"])
else:
    print(messages)
```

This code is also in test.py
