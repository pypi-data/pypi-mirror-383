```bash
moneyflow --demo
```

Perfect for:
- Trying before signing up for a finance platform

- Development without affecting real data

## Development Setup

If you want to contribute or modify the code:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wesm/moneyflow.git
cd moneyflow

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run from source
uv run moneyflow

# Run tests
uv run pytest
```

## CLI Options

By default, moneyflow fetches **all transactions** from your account. For very large accounts, you can limit the data range:

**Fetch only recent years:**
```bash
# Only load transactions from 2025 onwards
moneyflow --year 2025

# Only load transactions from 2024 onwards
moneyflow --year 2024
```

**Fetch from a specific date:**
```bash
# Load transactions from June 1, 2024 onwards
moneyflow --since 2024-06-01
```

**Enable caching for faster startup:**
```bash
# Cache data to avoid re-downloading
moneyflow --cache

# Force refresh (skip cache)
moneyflow --refresh
```

**View all options:**
```bash
moneyflow --help
```

**Note**: Limiting the date range makes initial load faster but you won't see older transactions in your analysis.

### First Run Setup (Monarch Money)

On first run with Monarch Money, the TUI will walk you through credential setup:

1. **Get your 2FA secret** (before you start):
   - Log into Monarch Money on the web
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Security
   - Disable and re-enable 2FA
   - Click "Can't scan?" to view the secret key
   - Copy the BASE32 secret (e.g., `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`)

2. **Launch moneyflow** and enter when prompted:
   - Monarch Money email and password
   - Your 2FA secret key
   - A new encryption password (for moneyflow only)

3. **Done!** Next time you launch, just enter your encryption password.

Your credentials are encrypted with AES-128 and stored in `~/.moneyflow/credentials.enc`.

**To reset credentials**: Click "Reset Credentials" on the unlock screen.

## Time Navigation

moneyflow downloads all transactions once, then filters client-side for fast switching between time periods.

**Keyboard shortcuts:**
- `y` - View current year
- `t` - View current month
- `a` - View all time
- `1-9` - View specific months (1=Jan, 2=Feb, etc.)
- `‚Üê` / `‚Üí` - Navigate to previous/next period

**Workflow:**
```
1. Launch TUI (downloads all transactions, may take 1-2 minutes for large accounts)
2. Default view: Current year
3. Press 't' to switch to current month
4. Press '‚Üê' to view previous month
5. Press 'y' to return to year view
6. Press 'a' to view all time
```

Time period changes are applied instantly using client-side filtering.

## Usage Examples

## Architecture

### Pluggable Backend System
The application uses a backend abstraction layer, allowing support for multiple finance platforms:

- **Backend Interface**: Abstract base class defines required methods
- **Monarch Backend**: Implementation for Monarch Money GraphQL API
- **Demo Backend**: Synthetic data for testing
- **Future**: Easy to add YNAB, Lunch Money, or other platforms

### Technology Stack
- **Polars**: Fast data aggregation and filtering
- **Textual**: Terminal UI framework
- **Python 3.11+**: Required runtime
- **Parquet**: Optional caching format (when --cache used)

## Performance

- Fetches all transactions on startup (1000 per batch)
- Aggregations performed locally using Polars (instant filtering and grouping)
- Updates committed in parallel to backend API for speed

## Troubleshooting

### "ModuleNotFoundError" when running

**Problem**: You see errors like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'textual'`

**Solution**: Reinstall moneyflow:
```bash
pip install --upgrade moneyflow
```

Or if running from source:
```bash
cd moneyflow
uv sync
```

### "uv: command not found"

**Problem**: After installing uv, the terminal says it can't find the command

**Solution**: Restart your terminal, or manually add uv to your PATH:
```bash
# macOS/Linux - add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### Login fails with "Incorrect password"

**Problem**: The TUI says "Incorrect password" when trying to unlock credentials

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure you're entering the **encryption password** (the one you created for moneyflow), not your Monarch Money password
2. If you forgot it, click "Reset Credentials" and go through setup again
3. If setup fails, you can manually delete: `rm -rf ~/.moneyflow/`

### 2FA/TOTP secret not working

**Problem**: Login fails even with correct credentials

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure you copied the **BASE32 secret** (the long string like `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`), not the QR code
2. Remove any spaces from the secret key
3. Get a fresh secret by disabling and re-enabling 2FA in Monarch Money settings

### Terminal displays weird characters or colors

**Problem**: The UI looks broken with strange characters

**Solution**: Use a modern terminal emulator that supports Unicode and ANSI colors:
- **macOS**: Terminal.app (built-in) or [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
- **Linux**: GNOME Terminal, Alacritty, or Kitty
- **Windows**: [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701)

### "Cannot import name 'PBKDF2HMAC'"

**Problem**: Error about cryptography imports

**Solution**: Your dependencies are out of date. Run:
```bash
uv sync --reinstall
```

### The TUI is blank or frozen after login

**Problem**: TUI launches but nothing shows up after entering credentials

**Solution**: This may be a data loading issue. Try:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Check the terminal size (make it larger)
3. Wait 30 seconds for data to load
4. Run with `--dev` flag to see error messages: `moneyflow --dev`

### I want to start over completely

To completely reset:
```bash
# Delete all stored data
rm -rf ~/.moneyflow/

# Delete session
rm -rf .mm/

# Reinstall (if installed from PyPI)
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall moneyflow

# Run again
moneyflow
```
