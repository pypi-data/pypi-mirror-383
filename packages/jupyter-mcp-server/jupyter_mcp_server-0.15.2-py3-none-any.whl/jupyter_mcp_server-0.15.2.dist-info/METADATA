> 🚨 **NEW IN 0.14.0:** Multi-notebook support! You can now seamlessly switch between multiple notebooks in a single session. [Read more in the release notes.](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/releases)

**Jupyter MCP Server** is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server implementation that enables **real-time** interaction with 📓 Jupyter Notebooks, allowing AI to edit, document and execute code for data analysis, visualization etc.

Compatible with any Jupyter deployment (local, JupyterHub, ...) and with [Datalayer](https://datalayer.ai/) hosted Notebooks.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ⚡ **Real-time control:** Instantly view notebook changes as they happen.
- 🔁 **Smart execution:** Automatically adjusts when a cell run fails thanks to cell output feedback.
- 🧠 **Context-aware:** Understands the entire notebook context for more relevant interactions.
- 📊 **Multimodal support:** Support different output types, including images, plots, and text.
- 📁 **Multi-notebook support:** Seamlessly switch between multiple notebooks.
- 🤝 **MCP-compatible:** Works with any MCP client, such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and more.

![Jupyter MCP Server Demo](https://assets.datalayer.tech/jupyter-mcp/mcp-demo-multimodal.gif)

🛠️ This MCP offers multiple tools such as `insert_cell`, `execute_cell`, `list_files`, `read_cell`, and more, enabling advanced interactions with Jupyter notebooks. Explore our [tools documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/tools) to learn about all the tools powering Jupyter MCP Server.

## 🏁 Getting Started

For comprehensive setup instructions—including `Streamable HTTP` transport, running as a Jupyter Server extension and advanced configuration—check out [our documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/). Or, get started quickly with `JupyterLab` and `STDIO` transport here below.

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
pip install jupyterlab==4.4.1 jupyter-collaboration==4.0.2 ipykernel
pip uninstall -y pycrdt datalayer_pycrdt
pip install datalayer_pycrdt==0.12.17
```

### 2. Start JupyterLab

```bash
# make jupyterlab
jupyter lab --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN --ip 0.0.0.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are running notebooks through JupyterHub instead of JupyterLab as above, you should:
>
> - Set the environment variable `JUPYTERHUB_ALLOW_TOKEN_IN_URL=1` in the single-user environment.
> - Ensure your API token (`MY_TOKEN`) is created with `access:servers` scope in the Hub.

### 3. Configure Your Preferred MCP Client

You can choose between two deployment methods: **uvx** (lightweight and faster, recommended for first try) or **Docker** (recommended for production).

<details>

<summary><b>Using uvx (Quick Start)</b></summary>

```bash
pip install uv
uv --version
# should be 0.6.14 or higher
```

See more details on [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["jupyter-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "DOCUMENT_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "DOCUMENT_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "DOCUMENT_ID": "notebook.ipynb",
        "RUNTIME_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "RUNTIME_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

        "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Linux**

      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-e", "DOCUMENT_URL",
        "-e", "DOCUMENT_TOKEN",
        "-e", "DOCUMENT_ID",
        "-e", "RUNTIME_URL",
        "-e", "RUNTIME_TOKEN",
        "-e", "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT",
        "--network=host",
        "datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DOCUMENT_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "DOCUMENT_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "DOCUMENT_ID": "notebook.ipynb",
        "RUNTIME_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "RUNTIME_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

> [!TIP]
>
> 1. Ensure the `port` of the `DOCUMENT_URL` and `RUNTIME_URL` match those used in the `jupyter lab` command.
>
> 1. In a basic setup, `DOCUMENT_URL` and `RUNTIME_URL` are the same. `DOCUMENT_TOKEN`, and `RUNTIME_TOKEN` are also the same and is actually the Jupyter Token.
>
> 1. The `DOCUMENT_ID` parameter specifies the path to the notebook you want to connect to. It should be relative to the directory where JupyterLab was started.
>
> - **Optional:** If you omit `DOCUMENT_ID`, the MCP client can automatically list all available notebooks on the Jupyter server, allowing you to select one interactively via your prompts.
> - **Flexible:** Even if you set `DOCUMENT_ID`, the MCP client can still browse, list, switch to, or even create new notebooks at any time.
