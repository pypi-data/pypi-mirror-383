# 🌸 Zen Garden

A beautiful CLI productivity timer with growing plants. Your plants grow as you focus, with events occurring every 15 minutes to remind you to take breaks.

## Features

- 🌱 **Real-Time Growth**: Plants animate and grow continuously with smooth transitions
- 🐌 **Adorable Snail**: Watch a snail patrol your garden and collect coins!
- ⏰ **Live Timer**: Real-time countdown to next break event (updates every second)
- ✨ **Smooth Animations**: Plants pulse and change slowly every 2 seconds
- ⌨️ **Instant Keybinds**: Press keys for instant actions (no Enter needed!)
- 🎨 **Beautiful CLI**: Colorful, animated interface that updates in real-time
- 🌺 **5 Plant Types**: Lotus (L), Bamboo (B), Cherry Blossom (C), Bonsai (O), Zen Flower (Z)
- 🪙 **Coin Collection**: Coins spawn randomly and the snail collects them as it patrols
- 📊 **Live Stats**: Track focus time, events, and plant progress in real-time
- 💾 **Auto-Save**: Garden state persists automatically
- ♾️ **Unlimited Plants**: Grow as many plants as you want!

## Installation

## Keybinds

The app responds instantly to keypresses (no Enter needed):

## How It Works

1. **Real-Time Display**: The garden updates continuously - timer counts down, plants animate
2. **Plant Seeds**: Press P, then choose a plant type with a single key
3. **Watch & Focus**: Plants pulse and animate every 2 seconds while you work
4. **Events**: Every 15 minutes, an event occurs and ALL plants grow one stage
5. **Breaks**: Short breaks every 15 minutes, long breaks every hour (4 events)
6. **Full Bloom**: After 4 hours (16 events/stages), plants reach full bloom!

## Plant Growth Stages

Plants progress through 16 animated stages over 4 hours:

- **Seed** (·○●) - Just planted, pulsing
- **Germinating** (○◌○) - 15 minutes
