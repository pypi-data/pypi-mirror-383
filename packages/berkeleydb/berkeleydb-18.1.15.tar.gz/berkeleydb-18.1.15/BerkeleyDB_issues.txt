- 20201211: In "docs/api_reference/C/envset_backup_callbacks.html", "open_func"
  gets a pointer to pointer. It is suppose to use it to store the handle for
  the other callbacks, but it is not explained in the documentation. In fact,
  the lifecycle of "handle" is not explained at all.

- 20201211: In "docs/api_reference/C/envset_backup_callbacks.html" the
  callbacks are declared as returning "int", but in the documentation nothing
  is said about what should be returned in the callbacks.

- 20201211: In "docs/api_reference/C/envget_backup_callbacks.html" it is said:
  "write_func: The close_func parameter is the function used to write data
  during a backup.". It should be "write_func", not "close_func".

- 20201211: In "docs/api_reference/C/envget_backup_config.html" and
  "docs/api_reference/C/envset_backup_config.html" there is no indication that
  those functions returns an "int".

- 20201211: In "db.h", "version()" is inside "DB_LOGC PUBLIC HANDLE LIST", but
  it is not documented anywhere.

- 20201210: In
  https://docs.oracle.com/database/bdb181/html/api_reference/C/dbset_lk_exclusive.html
  is said: "nowait_onoff: If set to 0, this method will block until it can
  obtain the exclusive lock on the database.". But "this method"
  (set_lk_exclusive) doesn't block, the method that would block is "db->open()".

- 20201206: Oracle Berkeley DB "heap" access method misscounts records in
  "db.stat()". Details at
