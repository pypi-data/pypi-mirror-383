# Changelog Management Decision: Manual with Targeted Automation

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Version:** TripWire v0.4.0
**Decision:** Hybrid approach - Manual changelog curation with automated validation and distribution

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing TripWire's git history, commit quality, release patterns, and the exceptional quality of the v0.4.0 CHANGELOG.md, I recommend **keeping manual changelog management** with targeted automation for validation and distribution.

**Key Insight:** The v0.4.0 changelog demonstrates exactly why automation would be a step backward. No tool can generate entries like this:

```markdown
- **Type Inference from Annotations**: TripWire now automatically infers types from variable annotations - no need to specify `type=` twice!
  ```python
  # Before (still works)
  PORT: int = env.require("PORT", type=int, min_val=1, max_val=65535)

  # Now (recommended)
  PORT: int = env.require("PORT", min_val=1, max_val=65535)
  ```
```

This level of user-focused documentation requires human judgment, code examples, and design rationale that commit messages cannot provide.

## Analysis Results

### Current State Assessment

**Changelog Quality: Exceptional**
- Detailed feature descriptions with user benefits
- Before/after code examples for API changes
- Design decisions explained
- Technical details included
- User-focused language throughout

**Commit Message Quality: Mixed**
```
Analysis of 30 recent commits:
- 43% use conventional commits (feat:, fix:)
- 43% use generic prefixes (Update, Add, Bump)
- 14% use descriptive prefixes (Refactor, Enhance)
```

**Release Frequency: Low-to-Medium**
- 4 releases in recent history (0.1.0 → 0.4.0)
- Average: 1 release per quarter
- Pattern: RC releases → stable releases

**Team Size: Solo/Small**
- Single primary contributor (Kibukx)
- PR-based workflow with feature branches
- High commit quality control

**Project Type: Python Library**
- Public package on PyPI
- Semantic versioning required
- Breaking changes need migration guidance
- API documentation critical

### Automation Tools Evaluated

**1. Conventional Changelog / semantic-release**
- **Pros:** Fully automated, consistent format, version bumping
- **Cons:**
  - Requires 100% conventional commit adoption (currently 43%)
  - Generates commit-focused content, not user-focused
  - No code examples or design rationale
  - Breaking changes need manual documentation anyway
- **Verdict:** Not suitable

**2. GitHub Auto-generate Release Notes**
- **Pros:** Zero configuration, based on PRs
- **Cons:**
  - PR titles are internal-focused ("Implement X", "Refactor Y")
  - No categorization by change type
  - No code examples
  - Includes internal changes not relevant to users
- **Verdict:** Not suitable

**3. Changelog Fragments (towncrier, scriv)**
- **Pros:** Distributed changelog writing, merge conflict avoidance
- **Cons:**
  - Overhead of managing fragment files
  - Better for high-velocity projects (10+ releases/year)
  - Still requires manual writing (just distributed)
  - TripWire has 4 releases/year - not needed yet
- **Verdict:** Overkill for current scale

**4. Hybrid: Manual + Automation**
- **Pros:**
  - Maintains changelog quality
  - Automates validation (ensures entries exist)
  - Automates distribution (GitHub releases)
  - No change to current workflow
  - Room to add more automation later if needed
- **Cons:**
  - Developer must remember to update CHANGELOG.md
  - (Mitigated by CI validation that fails if missing)
- **Verdict:** Recommended ✓

## Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

### What Stays Manual

**Changelog Writing** (the important part!)
- Feature descriptions with user benefits
- Code examples for API changes
- Design decisions and rationale
- Breaking change explanations
- Migration steps for upgrades

**When to Write:**
- During release preparation (before tagging)
- Use git log and PR descriptions as reference
- Spend 15-30 minutes per release crafting entries

### What Gets Automated

**1. Changelog Validation (CI)**
- Script: `.github/scripts/validate_changelog.sh`
- Runs during release workflow
- Ensures CHANGELOG.md has entry for the version
- Blocks release if changelog is missing/empty

**2. Release Notes Extraction (CI)**
- Script: `.github/scripts/extract_changelog.sh`
- Extracts version section from CHANGELOG.md
- Adds installation instructions and quick start
- Generates GitHub release body automatically

**3. Version Link Updates (Optional)**
- Script: `.github/scripts/update_changelog_links.sh`
- Updates comparison links at bottom of CHANGELOG.md
- Can run manually or be added to CI

### Implementation Status

**Completed:**
- ✓ Created validation script
- ✓ Created extraction script
- ✓ Created link update script
- ✓ Updated release workflow to validate changelog
- ✓ Updated release workflow to use extracted notes
- ✓ All scripts tested and working

**Documentation Created:**
- ✓ CHANGELOG_WORKFLOW.md - Complete workflow guide
- ✓ RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md - Step-by-step release checklist
- ✓ This decision document

## Workflow Example

### Before (Manual Only)
```bash
# Developer workflow
vim CHANGELOG.md          # Update manually
vim pyproject.toml        # Bump version
git commit -m "Release v0.5.0"
git tag v0.5.0
git push origin v0.5.0

# Risk: Might forget CHANGELOG.md
# Risk: GitHub release has generic content
```

### After (Hybrid)
```bash
# Developer workflow (unchanged except CI validates)
vim CHANGELOG.md          # Update manually
vim pyproject.toml        # Bump version
git commit -m "Release v0.5.0"
git tag v0.5.0
git push origin v0.5.0

# CI automatically:
# 1. Validates CHANGELOG.md exists (fails if missing)
# 2. Extracts release notes
# 3. Creates GitHub release with extracted content
# 4. Publishes to PyPI

# Benefits:
# ✓ Can't forget CHANGELOG.md (CI fails)
# ✓ GitHub release uses actual changelog
# ✓ Consistent formatting
# ✓ Quality maintained
```

## Decision Rationale

### Why Not Full Automation?

**1. Current Commit Quality Doesn't Support It**
- Only 43% of commits use conventional format
- Retrofit would require rewriting git history or inconsistent format
- Generated changelog would be low-quality

**2. Library Documentation Requires Human Curation**
Your users need:
- "Why" explanations, not just "what"
- Code examples showing API usage
- Migration steps for breaking changes
- Design rationale for major features

Example: Compare auto-generated vs. manual:

**Auto-generated (from commits):**
```markdown
## [0.4.0]
- feat: add type inference
- feat: add diff command
- fix: type inference bug
```

**Manual (actual v0.4.0):**
```markdown
## [0.4.0]
### Added
- **Type Inference from Annotations**: TripWire now automatically infers types from variable annotations - no need to specify `type=` twice!
  [code example]
  [bullet list of capabilities]

### Design Decisions
- **Why .env + TOML only?** Covers 95% of Python projects...
```

The difference is night and day.

**3. Release Frequency Doesn't Justify Automation**
- 4 releases/year = 1 hour/year spent on changelogs
- Setup/maintenance of automation tools = 4-8 hours
- ROI is negative

**4. Solo Developer = No Coordination Overhead**
- No need for distributed changelog fragments
- No merge conflicts on CHANGELOG.md
- No need to enforce conventional commits across team

### Why Not Pure Manual?

**1. Risk of Forgetting**
Without CI validation, it's easy to:
- Push a tag without updating CHANGELOG.md
- Create inconsistent GitHub release notes
- Forget to update version comparison links

**2. Manual GitHub Release Creation is Tedious**
- Copy-paste from CHANGELOG.md to GitHub UI
- Format markdown manually
- Add boilerplate (installation, quick start)
- Easy to make formatting mistakes

**3. Inconsistency Across Releases**
Different formats for different releases if done manually each time.

### Why Hybrid is Optimal

**1. Best of Both Worlds**
- Quality of manual curation
- Safety of automated validation
- Consistency of automated distribution

**2. Minimal Setup**
- 3 simple bash scripts (~100 lines total)
- No external dependencies
- Works with existing workflow

**3. Flexible for Future Growth**
If release velocity increases:
- Can add conventional commit enforcement
- Can add changelog fragment system
- Can migrate to semantic-release
- Foundation is already in place

**4. Immediate Value**
- Works today with v0.4.0 release
- No migration required
- No git history rewrite needed
- No new developer habits to learn

## Success Metrics

Track these to evaluate if the approach needs adjustment:

**Quality Metrics:**
- GitHub release notes match CHANGELOG.md: ✓ (automated)
- Code examples in changelog: ✓ (manual ensures this)
- User comprehension (issue questions about changes): Track

**Process Metrics:**
- Forgotten changelog entries: 0 (CI prevents this)
- Time to release: < 30 minutes from tag to PyPI
- Release errors requiring rollback: < 1% (validation prevents)

**Decision Points:**
- If release frequency > 10/year: Consider semantic-release
- If team size > 3: Consider changelog fragments (towncrier)
- If commit quality improves to 90%+ conventional: Re-evaluate automation

---

## Migration Path (If Needed Later)

If TripWire grows and needs more automation:

### Phase 1: Enforce Conventional Commits (6+ months)
```bash
# Add pre-commit hook
npm install -g @commitlint/cli
# Enforce feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.
```

### Phase 2: Add Changelog Fragments (12+ months)
```bash
pip install towncrier
# Each PR includes .changelog/fragment.md
# At release: towncrier build
```

### Phase 3: Consider Full Automation (18+ months)
```bash
# semantic-release with custom config
# Still allows manual override for quality
```

But don't do any of this unless:
- Release frequency > 10/year
- Team size > 5
- Time savings > setup cost

## Conclusion

**Decision: Hybrid approach (Manual + Targeted Automation)**

**Rationale:**
- Maintains exceptional changelog quality (see v0.4.0 example)
- Prevents forgotten entries via CI validation
- Automates tedious distribution tasks
- Works with current workflow
- Scales to future needs

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- Developer must write changelog entries (15-30 min/release)
- No automatic version bumping (already manual)
- Not suitable for high-velocity projects (10+/year)

**Investment:**
- Setup: 2 hours (completed)
- Per release: 20-30 minutes (same as before)
- Maintenance: < 1 hour/year

**Expected Benefits:**
- Zero forgotten changelogs (CI enforcement)
- Consistent GitHub releases (automated extraction)
- Maintained documentation quality (manual curation)
- Flexible for future evolution
