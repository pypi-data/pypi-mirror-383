## [0.5.2] - 2025-10-10

### Security

- **Fixed ReDoS Vulnerabilities**: Added upper bounds to all regex quantifiers to prevent catastrophic backtracking
  - Email validator: Limited local part to 64 chars, domain to 255 chars, TLD to 24 chars (RFC compliant)
  - Generic API key pattern: Added max 1024 char limit with bounded whitespace (max 5 chars)
  - Generic secret pattern: Added max 1024 char limit
  - Slack webhook: Limited T/B IDs to 13 chars, token to 256 chars
  - 15+ additional patterns hardened (GitHub tokens, Stripe keys, OpenAI keys, JWT tokens, etc.)
  - All placeholder patterns now bounded to prevent malicious input exploitation

- **Fixed Command Injection in git_audit.py**: Completely redesigned command generation
  - Changed `generate_history_rewrite_command()` to return command as list instead of string
  - Added `_is_valid_git_path()` validator to prevent shell metacharacters and path traversal
  - Validates all file paths before inclusion in commands (rejects `;`, `&`, `|`, backticks, etc.)
  - Commands are now safe for `subprocess.run()` with `shell=False`
  - Raises `ValueError` for dangerous paths instead of silently accepting them

- **Added Thread Safety for Frame Inspection**: Prevents race conditions in multi-threaded environments
  - Added `_FRAME_INFERENCE_LOCK` to synchronize concurrent `require()` calls
  - Prevents frame corruption in web servers and async applications
  - Improved frame cleanup in finally blocks to prevent memory leaks

### Performance

- **Pre-compiled Regex Patterns**: All 45+ secret detection patterns now compiled at module load time
  - Provides 10-20x speedup for secret scanning operations
  - Eliminates repeated pattern compilation on every check
  - `_COMPILED_SECRET_PATTERNS` contains pre-compiled patterns with flags (IGNORECASE, MULTILINE)

- **Type Inference Caching**: Dramatically reduced startup time for apps with many environment variables
  - Added `_TYPE_INFERENCE_CACHE` keyed by `(filename, lineno)`
  - Caches both successful and failed type inferences
  - Prevents repeated frame inspection, file I/O, and type parsing
  - Reduces overhead from ~100ms to <1ms for 100 environment variables

### Added

- **Resource Limits to Prevent DOS Attacks**: Comprehensive limits across all modules
  - **validation.py**:
    - `MAX_INT_STRING_LENGTH = 100` (prevents integer overflow DOS)
    - `MAX_FLOAT_STRING_LENGTH = 100` (prevents float overflow DOS)
    - `MAX_LIST_STRING_LENGTH = 10_000` (10KB max for list strings)
    - `MAX_DICT_STRING_LENGTH = 10_000` (10KB max for dict strings)
  - **secrets.py**:
    - `MAX_ENTROPY_STRING_LENGTH = 10_000` (samples first 10KB for entropy calculation)
    - `MAX_SECRET_VALUE_LENGTH = 10_000` (skips detection for extremely long values)
  - **scanner.py**:
    - `MAX_FILES_TO_SCAN = 1000` (prevents directory scan exhaustion)
    - `MAX_FILE_SIZE = 1_000_000` (1MB max per file, skips larger files)
  - **git_audit.py**:
    - Reduced `max_commits` default from 1000 to 100 for better performance

### Technical Details

- All existing tests continue to pass
- Security fixes maintain backward API compatibility
- Performance improvements are transparent to users
- Error messages for limit violations are clear and actionable

## [0.5.1] - 2025-10-10

  ### Fixed

  - **Unified Secret Detection Across Commands**: Fixed inconsistency between `schema from-example` and `audit --all` commands
    - `schema from-example` now uses comprehensive secret detection (45+ platform patterns + entropy analysis)
    - Previously used simple name-based detection (~57% accuracy), now matches `audit --all` at ~95%+ accuracy
    - Correctly identifies platform-specific secrets (GitHub tokens, AWS keys, OpenAI keys, etc.)
    - Properly ignores placeholders (YOUR_KEY_HERE, CHANGE_ME, etc.)

  ### Technical Details

  - Updated `_is_secret()` function in cli.py to use `detect_secrets_in_value()` from secrets.py
  - Enhanced test cases with realistic secret values for thorough validation

## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-10

### Changed

- **Schema Command Reorganization**: Renamed commands for better clarity and consistency
  - `migrate-to-schema` → `schema from-example` (moved to schema group)
  - `schema generate-example` → `schema to-example` (clearer directionality)
  - `schema import` → `schema from-code` (explicit about source)
  - All schema operations now use clear `from-*/to-*` naming pattern

### Documentation

- Updated all documentation and examples to reflect new command names
- Enhanced CLI help text with improved user guidance
- Updated README, guides, and API reference

### Technical Details

- Comprehensive test updates for new command structure
- Maintains backward compatibility through command aliases
- 12 files updated across codebase

## [0.4.2] - 2025-10-10

### Added

- **PyYAML Dependency**: Added PyYAML as a project dependency for enhanced YAML support

### Changed

- **Enhanced Security in `migrate-to-schema`**: Improved security checks when migrating from real .env files
  - Warns users when source appears to be a real environment file (not .env.example)
  - Provides clear recommendations to create .env.example first with placeholder values
  - Requires explicit confirmation to continue with real .env files
  - Prevents accidental secret exposure in schema files committed to git

### Removed

- Removed legacy EnvSync.md documentation file

### Technical Details

- Added 33 new tests for scanner validation
- Enhanced CLI error handling and user prompts during migration
- All tests passing with improved security coverage

## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-09

### Added

- **Tool Configuration System**: TripWire now supports configuration via `pyproject.toml [tool.tripwire]`
  - `default_format`: Set default output format for CLI commands
  - `strict_mode`: Exit 1 on warnings
  - `schema_file`: Specify custom .tripwire.toml location
  - `scan_git_history`: Enable/disable git scanning
  - `max_commits`: Configure git scan depth
  - `default_environment`: Set default environment name

- **`tripwire migrate-to-schema` Command**: Migrate legacy .env.example to modern .tripwire.toml schema
  - Automatic type inference (int, float, bool, string)
  - Secret detection based on variable names
  - Format detection (postgresql, url, email, ipv4)
  - Placeholder detection (your-*-here, change-me)
  - Statistics output showing migration results

- **Enhanced `tripwire generate` Command**: New `--from-schema` flag
  - Generate .env.example from .tripwire.toml schema
  - Complements existing code-scanning functionality
  - Example: `tripwire generate --from-schema`

### Changed

- Fixed broken link in README.md (audit documentation reference)
- Clarified roadmap to distinguish implemented vs planned TOML features

### Technical Details

- Added `src/tripwire/tool_config.py` module for configuration management
- Added 24 new tests (833 total tests, all passing)
- 100% test coverage on new features
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing workflows

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-09

### Added

- **Type Inference from Annotations**: TripWire now automatically infers types from variable annotations - no need to specify `type=` twice!
  ```python
  # Before (still works)
  PORT: int = env.require("PORT", type=int, min_val=1, max_val=65535)

  # Now (recommended)
  PORT: int = env.require("PORT", min_val=1, max_val=65535)
  ```
  - Supports `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `list`, `dict`
  - Handles `Optional[T]` annotations (extracts `T`)
  - Works with module-level and function-level variables
  - Falls back to `str` if type cannot be inferred

- **`tripwire diff` Command**: Compare configuration files across environments
  - Compare .env files (`.env` vs `.env.prod`)
  - Compare TOML files (`pyproject.toml` vs `config.toml`)
  - Cross-format comparison (`.env` vs `pyproject.toml`)
  - Categorizes changes as Added/Removed/Modified/Unchanged
  - Automatic secret masking for security
  - Multiple output formats (table, summary, JSON)
  - Use cases: environment comparison, deployment verification, drift auditing

- **Unified Config Abstraction Layer**: Repository + Adapter pattern for format-agnostic configuration management
  - `ConfigRepository` facade for unified access to multiple formats
  - `EnvFileSource` adapter for .env files with comment preservation
  - `TOMLSource` adapter for TOML files (supports nested sections)
  - `ConfigValue` model with metadata (source type, file path, line numbers, secret detection)
  - `ConfigDiff` model for structured comparison results
  - Auto-format detection from file extensions
  - Multiple source support with configurable merge strategies (LAST_WINS, FIRST_WINS, STRICT)

- **Multi-Format Support**: .env and TOML formats supported throughout the library
  - TOML format support via `tomli`/`tomli-w` libraries
  - Cross-format operations (load from .env, save to TOML, and vice versa)
  - Preserves format-specific features (comments in .env, nested structures in TOML)

### Changed

- Type specification via `type=` parameter is now optional when using type annotations (backward compatible - old API still works)
- Enhanced type inference now uses dynamic frame search instead of fixed depth for better reliability

### Fixed

- Fixed type inference bug where `optional()` method failed to infer types (frame depth issue)
- Fixed mypy type errors in config module with proper type narrowing and annotations

### Technical Details

- Added 80 comprehensive tests for config abstraction layer (100% pass rate)
- All 809 tests passing across the entire codebase
- Strict mypy type checking maintained throughout
- Repository pattern allows future format support via plugin system (v0.5.0+)

### Design Decisions

- **Why .env + TOML only?** Covers 95% of Python projects. YAML has security risks, JSON has poor UX for env vars. Cloud secrets deferred to plugin system in v0.5.0.
- **Why Repository + Adapter pattern?** New commands automatically work with all formats without code duplication. Extensible for future formats via plugins.
