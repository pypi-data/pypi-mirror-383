### Migration Guide

**No changes required for most users:**
```python

from tripwire import env
PORT: int = env.require("PORT", min_val=1, max_val=65535)
```

**Advanced users can leverage new features:**
```python
# Dependency injection for testing
from tripwire import TripWire
from tripwire.core import EnvFileLoader, DotenvFileSource

custom_loader = EnvFileLoader([DotenvFileSource(Path(".env.test"))])
env = TripWire(loader=custom_loader)

# Only if you encounter issues with TripWireV2
from tripwire import TripWireLegacy
env = TripWireLegacy()  # Shows deprecation warning
```

  - Reduces overhead from ~100ms to <1ms for 100 environment variables

### Added

- **Resource Limits to Prevent DOS Attacks**: Comprehensive limits across all modules
  - **validation.py**:
    - `MAX_INT_STRING_LENGTH = 100` (prevents integer overflow DOS)
    - `MAX_FLOAT_STRING_LENGTH = 100` (prevents float overflow DOS)
    - `MAX_LIST_STRING_LENGTH = 10_000` (10KB max for list strings)

  - **secrets.py**:
    - `MAX_ENTROPY_STRING_LENGTH = 10_000` (samples first 10KB for entropy calculation)
    - `MAX_SECRET_VALUE_LENGTH = 10_000` (skips detection for extremely long values)

  - `strict_mode`: Exit 1 on warnings
  - `schema_file`: Specify custom .tripwire.toml location
  - `scan_git_history`: Enable/disable git scanning
  - `max_commits`: Configure git scan depth
  - `default_environment`: Set default environment name

- **`tripwire migrate-to-schema` Command**: Migrate legacy .env.example to modern .tripwire.toml schema
  - Automatic type inference (int, float, bool, string)
  - Secret detection based on variable names
  - Format detection (postgresql, url, email, ipv4)
  - Placeholder detection (your-*-here, change-me)
  - Statistics output showing migration results

- **Enhanced `tripwire generate` Command**: New `--from-schema` flag

### Technical Details

- Added `src/tripwire/tool_config.py` module for configuration management
- Added 24 new tests (833 total tests, all passing)
- 100% test coverage on new features
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing workflows

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-09

### Added

- **Type Inference from Annotations**: TripWire now automatically infers types from variable annotations - no need to specify `type=` twice!
  ```python
  # Before (still works)
  PORT: int = env.require("PORT", type=int, min_val=1, max_val=65535)

  # Now (recommended)
  PORT: int = env.require("PORT", min_val=1, max_val=65535)
  ```
  - Supports `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `list`, `dict`
  - Handles `Optional[T]` annotations (extracts `T`)
  - Works with module-level and function-level variables
  - Falls back to `str` if type cannot be inferred

- **`tripwire diff` Command**: Compare configuration files across environments
  - Compare .env files (`.env` vs `.env.prod`)
  - Compare TOML files (`pyproject.toml` vs `config.toml`)
  - Cross-format comparison (`.env` vs `pyproject.toml`)
  - Categorizes changes as Added/Removed/Modified/Unchanged
  - Automatic secret masking for security
  - Multiple output formats (table, summary, JSON)
  - Use cases: environment comparison, deployment verification, drift auditing

- **Unified Config Abstraction Layer**: Repository + Adapter pattern for format-agnostic configuration management
  - `ConfigRepository` facade for unified access to multiple formats
  - `EnvFileSource` adapter for .env files with comment preservation
  - `TOMLSource` adapter for TOML files (supports nested sections)
  - `ConfigValue` model with metadata (source type, file path, line numbers, secret detection)
  - `ConfigDiff` model for structured comparison results
  - Auto-format detection from file extensions
  - Multiple source support with configurable merge strategies (LAST_WINS, FIRST_WINS, STRICT)

- **Multi-Format Support**: .env and TOML formats supported throughout the library
  - TOML format support via `tomli`/`tomli-w` libraries
  - Cross-format operations (load from .env, save to TOML, and vice versa)
  - Preserves format-specific features (comments in .env, nested structures in TOML)

### Changed

- Type specification via `type=` parameter is now optional when using type annotations (backward compatible - old API still works)
- Enhanced type inference now uses dynamic frame search instead of fixed depth for better reliability

### Fixed

- Fixed type inference bug where `optional()` method failed to infer types (frame depth issue)
- Fixed mypy type errors in config module with proper type narrowing and annotations

### Technical Details

- Added 80 comprehensive tests for config abstraction layer (100% pass rate)
- All 809 tests passing across the entire codebase
- Strict mypy type checking maintained throughout
- Repository pattern allows future format support via plugin system (v0.5.0+)

### Design Decisions

- **Why .env + TOML only?** Covers 95% of Python projects. YAML has security risks, JSON has poor UX for env vars. Cloud secrets deferred to plugin system in v0.5.0.
- **Why Repository + Adapter pattern?** New commands automatically work with all formats without code duplication. Extensible for future formats via plugins.
