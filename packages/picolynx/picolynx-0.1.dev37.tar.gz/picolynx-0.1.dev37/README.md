# PicoLynx - Attach Microcontrollers to WSL

PicoLynx is a Windows-only TUI (Text-based User Interface) application for attaching and detaching microcontroller devices to WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) distributions. It monitors Windows [`WM_DEVICECHANGE`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/devio/wm-devicechange) messages
with `pywin32` and leverages `usbipd-win` to manage device connections.

## Features

- **Manual control**: Easily attach, bind, detach, or unbind devices using keyboard shortcuts.
- **Live device table**: View connected and persisted devices in real time.
- **Windows message monitoring**: Reacts instantly to hardware changes.
- **Thread-safe**: Ensures safe device operations even with concurrent events.
- **Beautiful TUI**: Built with `Textual` for a modern terminal experience & many theme options.
- **Auto-attachment (TODO)**: Detects devices as they are connected & automatically attaches to WSL.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (Windows-only)
- `usbipd-win` (must be installed & available in your PATH)
- `WSL` with at least one running distribution (for attachment)
- Python 3.11+ (recommended via Astral's uv package manager)

`PicoLynx` requires administrator privileges to interact with USB devices. If not run as administrator, it will prompt for elevation.

## Installation

To install Astral `uv`, use the following command:

```sh
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Astral uv package manager is recommended for a fast, isolated, and reliable install. You can install `PicoLynx` globally with the following `uv` command:

```sh
uv tool install picolynx
```

Or:

```sh
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/andyrids/picolynx.git"
```

You can run `PicoLynx` without installing, by running the following command:

```sh
uvx picolynx
```

Or:

```sh
uvx "git+https://github.com/andyrids/picolynx.git"
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| --- | ------ |
|  a  | Attach |
|  b  | Bind   |
|  d  | Detach |
|  u  | Unbind |

Select a device in the table and press the corresponding key to perform the action.

## Development

The `just` command runner ([GitHub page](https://github.com/casey/just)) is a handy way to save and run project-specific commands, which are written in a file called `justfile`.

If you use `just`, you can add use the commands below to run `PicoLynx` in development mode, with the `textual` console integration:

This command uses `uv` to sync the package dependencies and create a `.venv`:

```sh
just sync
```

Alias for:

```sh
uv sync
```

Running the command below in one terminal, will activate the `textual` console:

```sh
just console
```

Alias for:

```sh
uv run textual console -x EVENT -x SYSTEM
```

Running this command will run `PicoLynx` in development mode.

```sh
just dev
```

Alias for:

```sh
uv run textual run --dev src/picolynx/__main__.py
```
