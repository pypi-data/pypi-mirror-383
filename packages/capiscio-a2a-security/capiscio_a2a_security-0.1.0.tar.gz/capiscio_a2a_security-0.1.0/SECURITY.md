## Security Best Practices

When using CapiscIO A2A Security:

1. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade capiscio-a2a-security
   ```

2. **Use signature verification**
   ```python
   config = SecurityConfig(
       downstream=DownstreamConfig(verify_signatures=True)
   )
   ```

3. **Enable rate limiting**
   ```python
   config = SecurityConfig(
       downstream=DownstreamConfig(enable_rate_limiting=True)
   )
   ```

4. **Use strict mode in production**
   ```python
   config = SecurityConfig.strict()
   ```

5. **Monitor logs for validation failures**
   ```python
   config = SecurityConfig(log_validation_failures=True)
   ```

## Known Security Considerations

### JWS Signature Verification

- Uses `cryptography` library (audited, industry standard)
- Supports RS256, RS384, RS512 algorithms
- JWKS endpoints must use HTTPS

### Rate Limiting

- In-memory implementation (single-server only)
- For distributed systems, use external rate limiter

### Caching

- Validation results cached with TTL
- Cache keys include content hashes
- Invalidation on configuration changes

## Security Scanning

This project uses:
- Dependabot for dependency updates
- CodeQL for static analysis
- Safety for Python dependency checking
