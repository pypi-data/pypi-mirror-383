# CapiscIO A2A Security Examples

This directory contains complete, runnable examples demonstrating how to integrate CapiscIO A2A Security with real A2A agents.

## üöÄ Quick Start: Simple Secured Agent

The best way to get started is with our complete example agent:

```bash
cd examples/simple_agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Then in another terminal:

```bash
python test_client.py
```

This demonstrates a fully functional A2A agent with security middleware in action!

## Available Examples

### Complete Running Examples

#### **Simple Secured Agent** (`simple_agent/`)

A complete A2A agent with security integrated, demonstrating:

- ‚úÖ Basic agent executor implementation following A2A best practices
- ‚úÖ Security integration using the minimal pattern
- ‚úÖ Testing with valid/invalid requests
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting, validation, and error handling in action
- ‚úÖ Runnable server and test client

**[See detailed README](simple_agent/README.md)**

### Code Pattern Examples

*(Standalone code examples - coming soon)*

- `01_minimal_integration.py` - Minimal one-liner integration
- `02_explicit_config.py` - Explicit configuration pattern
- `03_decorator_pattern.py` - Decorator-based integration
- `04_environment_config.py` - Environment-based configuration

## Running Examples

Each example is self-contained with its own:

- `README.md` - Detailed documentation
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies (for running examples)
- `main.py` - Server to run
- `test_client.py` - Client to test with

### General Pattern

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd <example-name>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Test the agent (in another terminal):**
   ```bash
   python test_client.py
   ```

## What You'll Learn

### Security Integration

All examples demonstrate:

- How to wrap an `AgentExecutor` with security
- Different configuration patterns (minimal, explicit, environment-driven)
- How to customize security settings
- How to observe validation results

### Testing Security

Examples include test clients that demonstrate:

- ‚úÖ Valid requests passing through
- üõ°Ô∏è Invalid requests being blocked
- üö¶ Rate limiting in action
- üìä Validation logging and monitoring

### Production Patterns

Examples follow production best practices:

- Proper error handling
- Structured logging
- Configuration management
- A2A protocol compliance

## Using Examples as Integration Tests

These examples also serve as integration tests. See `tests/integration/` for automated tests using the example agents.

## Next Steps

1. **Run the `simple_agent` example** to see security in action
2. **Modify the agent** to add your own capabilities
3. **Customize security** to match your requirements
4. **Deploy to production** using the patterns learned
