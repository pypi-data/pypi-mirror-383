"""Compatibility layer for fba_bench_core.domain.events.

This module re-exports all event classes, command classes, unions (AnyEvent, AnyCommand),
EventType enum, and helper functions from the modular domain/events submodules to
provide full backward compatibility. Existing code importing from fba_bench_core.domain.events
will continue to work unchanged.

Do not add new definitions here; maintain only re-exports and registry logic.
