"""Base exceptions for fba_bench_core.

This module defines the foundational exception hierarchy used across
the fba_bench_core package. It provides a single root exception and
a couple of commonly-used subclasses to improve error handling and
exception semantics throughout the project.

Classes:
- FBABenchException: Root exception for all fba_bench_core errors.
- ConfigurationError: Raised for configuration-related problems.
- AgentError: Raised for errors during agent execution or lifecycle.
"""


class FBABenchException(Exception):
    """Base exception for fba_bench_core.

    Acts as the common ancestor for all library-specific exceptions so
    callers can catch library errors without accidentally catching other
    exceptions that inherit directly from Exception.

    """Raised for agent execution or lifecycle failures.

    Use this when an agent encounters an unrecoverable error during
    planning, execution, or coordination.
