This module adds a new splitting mode to the `stock_split_picking` module.

The new mode `Quantity of kits` allows splitting a transfer by a specified number of kits.
A new field on the wizard also allows specifying a sort order for the stock moves before
splitting the transfer.

Multi level boms are not supported.

When a move needs to be split, it will be unreserved if needed.
And reassigned after the split operation.
