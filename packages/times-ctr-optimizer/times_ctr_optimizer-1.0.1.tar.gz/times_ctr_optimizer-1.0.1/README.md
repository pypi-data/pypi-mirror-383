## üéØ What is Times CTR Optimizer?

A professional-grade Python library for building and optimizing CTR (Click-Through Rate) systems. Generate realistic ad engagement data, optimize revenue, and build production-ready recommendation engines.

Developed during an internship at **Times Network** by an **MTech AI student from IIT Patna**, combining academic research with industry-grade implementation.

**üèÜ Key Performance Metrics:**
- **20.4% CTR Achievement** - Industry-leading click-through rates
- **12.9% Sponsored Integration** - Optimal revenue balance  
- **<1MB Memory Footprint** - Production efficiency
- **5,000+ Events Generated** - Professional scale testing

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
pip install times-ctr-optimizer

text

### Basic Usage
import times_ctr_optimizer

Initialize the CTR optimization system
optimizer = times_ctr_optimizer.CTROptimizer()

Generate realistic data and see performance
results = optimizer.quick_demo()

print(f"üéØ CTR Performance: {results['ctr']*100:.1f}%")
print(f"üí∞ Revenue Integration: {results['sponsored_ratio']*100:.1f}%")
print(f"üìä Events Generated: {len(results['events']):,}")

text

### Advanced Usage
Generate custom dataset
events, items = optimizer.generate_data(
n_users=100000,
n_items=50000,
n_events=1000000
)

Build feature engineering pipeline
user_store, item_store = optimizer.build_features(events, items)

print(f"‚úÖ Generated {len(events):,} realistic events")
print(f"‚úÖ Built features for {len(user_store):,} users")
