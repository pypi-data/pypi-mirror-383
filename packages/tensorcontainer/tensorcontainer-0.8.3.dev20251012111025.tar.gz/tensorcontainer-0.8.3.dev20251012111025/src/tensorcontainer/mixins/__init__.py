"""TensorContainer operation mixins for modular functionality.

This module provides operation mixins that can be combined with TensorContainer
to create custom tensor containers with only the desired functionality.

Available mixins:
- TensorShapeOperationsMixin: Shape transformation operations (view, reshape, etc.)
- TensorMathOperationsMixin: Mathematical operations (add, sub, mul, etc.)
- TensorTypeOperationsMixin: Type conversion operations (float, int, etc.)
- TensorDeviceOperationsMixin: Device and memory operations (to, cpu, cuda, etc.)
