    A filesystem wrapper that provides fallback functionality.

    This filesystem wraps another filesystem and provides a fallback mechanism
    where files are copied from a backup location to the underlying filesystem
    only when they are accessed. This allows for lazy loading of files from a backup.

    The fallback system uses stats to proxy ls info/stats without having to copy the file over.
    This is also used to keep track of which files still need to be recovered.

    Key Features:
        * Lazy loading of files from a backup location
        * Transparent proxying of filesystem operations to the underlying filesystem
        * Tracking of files that still need to be recovered
