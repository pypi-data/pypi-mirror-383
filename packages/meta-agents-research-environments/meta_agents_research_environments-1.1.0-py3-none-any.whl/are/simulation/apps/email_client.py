class EmailClientApp(App):

    An email client application that manages email operations and folder organization. This class provides comprehensive
    functionality for handling emails including sending, receiving, organizing, and managing email attachments.

    The app maintains emails in different folders (INBOX, SENT, DRAFT, TRASH) and provides various operations
    for email manipulation and searching.

    Key Features:
    - Email Management: Send, reply, move, and delete emails
    - Folder Organization: Maintains separate folders for different email categories
    - Attachment Support: Handle email attachments (upload and download)
    - Search Functionality: Search emails across folders with text-based queries
    - State Management: Save and load application state

    Key Components:
    - Folders: Each EmailFolder instance (INBOX, SENT, DRAFT, TRASH) maintains its own collection of emails
    - Email Validation: Validates email addresses using regex pattern matching
    - View Limits: Configurable limit for email viewing and pagination
    - Event Registration: All operations are tracked through event registration

    Notes:
    - Email IDs are automatically generated when creating new emails
    - Attachments are handled using base64 encoding
    - Search operations are case-insensitive
    - All email operations maintain folder integrity
    - Supports CC recipients and multiple attachments
