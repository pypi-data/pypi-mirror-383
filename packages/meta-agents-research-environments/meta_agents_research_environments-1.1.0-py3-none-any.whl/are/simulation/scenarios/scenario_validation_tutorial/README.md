# Validation Tutorial Scenario

This scenario demonstrates different validation patterns in Meta Agents Research Environments including environment state validation, agent validation events, and milestone and minefield patterns.

## Overview

The `ScenarioValidationTutorial` scenario provides a comprehensive guide to implementing validation in Meta Agents Research Environments scenarios. It demonstrates environment state validation for checking final state, agent validation events for real-time validation of agent actions, milestone and minefield patterns for things that should or shouldn't happen, and timeout-based validation for time-constrained validation. The scenario simulates a simple conversation where the user asks the agent to identify itself and validates that the agent responds correctly.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To run the validation tutorial scenario:

```bash
python -m are.simulation.scenarios.scenario_validation_tutorial.scenario
