# Tutorial Scenario

This scenario demonstrates the fundamental concepts of Meta Agents Research Environments scenario development using a realistic email workflow.

## Overview

The `ScenarioTutorial` scenario provides a comprehensive introduction to building Meta Agents Research Environments scenarios. It creates a complete simulation environment with multiple applications (calendar, email, contacts, file system, messaging, and system) and demonstrates how to create realistic event flows where agents must process incoming messages and coordinate email forwarding tasks between contacts.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To run the tutorial scenario:

```bash
python -m are.simulation.scenarios.scenario_tutorial.scenario
