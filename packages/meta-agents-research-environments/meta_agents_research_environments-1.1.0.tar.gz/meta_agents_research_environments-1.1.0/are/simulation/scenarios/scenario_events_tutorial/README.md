# Events Tutorial Scenario

This scenario demonstrates the fundamental concepts of events in Meta Agents Research Environments including scheduled events, conditional events, and event dependencies.

## Overview

The `ScenarioEventsTutorial` scenario provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing different types of events in Meta Agents Research Environments. It covers scheduled events that happen at specific times, conditional events triggered by environment conditions, event dependencies that chain events together, and different event creation patterns. The scenario simulates an email workflow where initial emails are sent at scheduled times and conditional events trigger based on the number of received emails.
