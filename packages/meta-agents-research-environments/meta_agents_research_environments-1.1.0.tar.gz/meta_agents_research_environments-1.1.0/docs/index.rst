:octicon:`home` Welcome to Meta Agents Research Environments
============================================================

**Meta Agents Research Environments (ARE)** is a dynamic simulation research platform for training and evaluating AI agents on complex, multi-step tasks that mirror real-world challenges. Unlike static benchmarks, ARE creates evolving environments where agents must adapt their strategies as new information emerges and conditions change over time. In particular, ARE runs the :doc:`Gaia2 Benchmark <user_guide/gaia2_evaluation>`, a follow-up to `Gaia <https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12983>`_, evaluating a broader range of agent capabilities.

:octicon:`zap` What Can ARE Do?
-------------------------------

:octicon:`sync` **Dynamic Simulations**
    Create realistic scenarios that evolve over minutes, hours, or days - simulating complex workflows that require persistent reasoning and adaptation.

:octicon:`beaker` **Agent Evaluation**
    Test AI agents on multi-step tasks with comprehensive benchmarking tools, including the Gaia2 benchmark with 800 scenarios across 10 universes.

:octicon:`apps` **Interactive Applications**
    Agents interact with realistic apps like email, calendars, file systems, and messaging - each with domain-specific data and behaviors.

:octicon:`graph` **Research & Benchmarking**
    Systematic evaluation with parallel execution, multiple model support, and automatic result collection for the research community.

:octicon:`telescope` Next Steps
