# Cronico

Cronico is a lightweight, YAML-based task scheduler for Unix-like systems.

It lets you define recurring jobs with flexible cron expressions â€” supporting traditional minute-based syntax, extended formats with seconds, and common shorthand aliases (@daily, @hourly, etc.).

Tasks can include:
-	Retry policies with configurable attempts.
-	Timeouts to kill long-running processes.
-	Environment injection from .env files or inline variables.
-	Working directory control per task.
- Streaming or buffered logs for stdout/stderr.

Cronico is designed to run as a long-lived daemon (via systemd or similar) and can reload its configuration on SIGHUP without restarting the process.

      day: "*"
      month: "*"
      weekday: "*"

  daily_with_seconds:
    description: |
      Daily at 03:00:15
    cron:
      minute: 0
      hour: 3
      day: "*"
      month: "*"
      weekday: "*"

    command: "echo 'Daily at 03:00:15'"

  shorthand:
    description: |
      Shorthand: daily, at 00:00
    cron: "@daily"
    command: |
        echo "Supported aliases:"
        echo "- @yearly: 0 0 1 1 *"
        echo "- @annually: 0 0 1 1 *"
        echo "- @monthly: 0 0 1 * *"
        echo "- @weekly: 0 0 * * 0"
        echo "- @daily: 0 0 * * *"
        echo "- @midnight: 0 0 * * *"
        echo "- @hourly: 0 * * * *"

      You can use a shebang to specify the interpreter to use.
    cron: "*/10 * * * *"
    command: |
      #!/usr/bin/env python3

      import datetime
      print("Hello from Python at", datetime.datetime.now())

      Another one...
    cron: "*/10 * * * *"
    command: |
      #!/usr/bin/env perl

      use strict;
      use warnings;
      my ($sec,$min,$hour) = localtime();
      print "Hello from Perl at $hour:$min:$sec\n";

  and_another_shebang_example:
    description: |
      I think you get the idea.
    cron: "*/10 * * * *"
    command: |
      #!/usr/bin/env perl

      use strict;
      use warnings;
      my ($sec,$min,$hour) = localtime();
      print "Hello from Perl at $hour:$min:$sec\n";
