        This shows the basic features of bencher.  These examples are purposefully simplified to demonstrate its features in isolation and don't reeally show the real advantages of bencher.  If you only have a few inputs and outputs its not that complicated to throw together some plots of performance.  The power of bencher is that when you have a system with many moving parts that all interact with each other, teasing apart those influences becomes much harder because the parameter spaces combine quite quickly into a high dimensional mess. Bencher makes it easier to experiment with different combination of inputs to gain an intuition of the system performance. Bencher can plot up to 6D input natively and you can add custom plots if you have exotic data types or state spaces [WIP].
