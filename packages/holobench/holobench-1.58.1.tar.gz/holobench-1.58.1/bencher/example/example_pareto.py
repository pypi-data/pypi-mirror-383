Advanced Pareto Optimization Example with Randomness

This example demonstrates multi-objective optimization using Optuna with the Bencher framework.
It shows how to:
1. Define a problem with multiple competing objectives
2. Use Optuna's multi-objective optimization capabilities
3. Visualize and analyze the Pareto front
4. Compare different optimization approaches
5. Demonstrate the effect of randomness on Pareto optimization
