class DiffEqModule(brainstate.mixin.Mixin):
    """
    A mixin class that provides differential equation functionality.

    This class serves as a mixin to add differential equation capabilities to other classes.
    It defines the core interface for implementing ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
    and stochastic differential equations (SDEs).

    The class includes methods for pre-integration preparation, derivative computation,
    and post-integration processing. Subclasses must implement the compute_derivative
    method to define the specific differential equation for the system.

        ----------
        *args : tuple
            Variable length argument list.
        **kwargs : dict

        Parameters
        ----------
        *args : tuple
            Variable length argument list.

class IndependentIntegration(brainstate.mixin.Mixin):
    """
    Mixin class to indicate independent integration of module states.

    This class serves as a marker for modules whose states should be excluded from
    the main integration process and instead be integrated independently. When a
    module inherits from `IndependentIntegration`, its states are not included in
    the set of states to be integrated by the primary numerical integrator.

    This is useful in scenarios where certain subsystems require specialized or
    decoupled integration strategies, such as different time steps or custom solvers.

    Usage of this mixin allows the integration framework to identify and handle
    such modules separately, ensuring modularity and flexibility in the integration
    of complex systems.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> class MySubsystem(IndependentIntegration, DiffEqModule):
    ...     pass
    >>> # States in MySubsystem will be integrated independently.

    Notes
    -----
    - This class does not implement any additional methods or properties.
    - It is intended to be used as a mixin alongside other module base classes.
