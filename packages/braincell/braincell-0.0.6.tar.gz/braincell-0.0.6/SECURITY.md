# Security Policy

## Reporting a bug in ``BrainCell``

Report security bugs in ``BrainCell`` via [Github Issue](https://github.com/chaobrain/braincell/issues).

Normally your report will be acknowledged within 5 days, and you'll receive a more detailed response 
to your report within 10 days indicating the next steps in handling your submission. These timelines 
may extend when our triage volunteers are away on holiday, particularly at the end of the year.

After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the 
progress being made towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or 
guidance surrounding the reported issue.

## Reporting a bug in a third party module

Security bugs in third party modules should be reported to their respective maintainers.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us as soon as possible. 
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your 
contributions.
