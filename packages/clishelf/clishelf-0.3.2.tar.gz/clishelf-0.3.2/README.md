A **CLI tools and hooks on my shelf** for my any Python packages.
This project help me to make Versioning, run Abbreviate of Git CLI.

> [!NOTE]
> This project was created because I do not want to hard code set up all of them
> every time when I start create a new Python package :tired_face:. I provide some
> reusable CLIs that was implemented by [`Click`](https://github.com/pallets/click/).

## :package: Installation

```shell
pip install -U clishelf
```

In the future, I will add more the CLI tools that able to dynamic with
many style of config such as I want to make changelog file with style B by my
custom message code.

## :dart: Mini-Roadmap

- (**Optional**) I will implement use `rich` and `alive-progress` to this project for make
  interface terminal prettier.
- (**Optional**) Dynamic emoji changing for support other platform such as GitLab.
- (**BIG**) Remove `bump2version` package and implement my bump function instead.

> [!NOTE]
> I will migrate this code from **Python** to **Rust** for performance of this CLI
> (But I will observe for this again because this package does not have any issue with perf as well).

## :speech_balloon: Contribute

I do not think this project will go around the world because it has specific propose,
and you can create by your coding without this project dependency for long term
solution. So, on this time, you can open [the GitHub issue on this project :raised_hands:](https://github.com/korawica/clishelf/issues)
for fix bug or request new feature if you want it.
