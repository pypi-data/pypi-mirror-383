"""Card game engine, AI, and CLI helpers for the game of Bluff (a.k.a. Cheat).

This module provides a comprehensive implementation of the card game "Bluff"
(also known as "Cheat" or "I Doubt It"). It includes the game engine, bot AI,
and hooks for both command-line and graphical user interfaces.

The game is structured around these key components:

* **Phases** – The :class:`Phase` enum models the three states of play
  (``TURN``, ``CHALLENGE``, and ``COMPLETE``) so the engine can react
  appropriately to user and AI choices.
* **Player representation** – :class:`PlayerState` tracks a player's hand, bot
  personality, and historical statistics that inform the AI's decision making.
* **Game state** – The :class:`BluffGame` class manages the deck, discard pile,
  pending challenges, and the overall flow of the match.
* **Bot AI** – Bot behaviour is parameterised by :class:`DifficultyLevel`
  objects, giving each difficulty setting a distinct "personality".
* **User interaction** – Helper functions at the bottom of the module wire the
  engine into an interactive CLI, while :mod:`card_games.bluff.gui` provides a
  Tkinter interface.

In addition to the public API, the module contains numerous helper functions
with richly documented behaviour intended to act as executable documentation for
the game's rules. These docstrings deliberately repeat concepts established in
other parts of the file so that each class or function can be understood in
isolation.
