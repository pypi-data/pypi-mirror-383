## Adding a New Game

### Game Structure

Each game should follow this structure:

```
game_name/
├── __init__.py          # Package initialization
├── __main__.py          # Entry point (python -m package.game_name)
├── game_name.py         # Core game logic
├── cli.py              # Command-line interface (optional)
├── gui.py              # Graphical interface (optional)
├── README.md           # Game-specific documentation
└── tests/              # Game-specific tests (or in top-level tests/)
    └── test_game_name.py
```

### Required Components

Every game must include:

1. **Game Engine**: Core logic independent of UI
1. **Documentation**: Module docstrings, function docstrings, README
1. **CLI Interface**: At minimum, a playable command-line version
1. **Tests**: Unit tests for game logic
1. **Entry Point**: Runnable via `python -m package.game_name`

### Game Engine Template

```python
"""Game Name - Brief description.

Detailed module docstring explaining:
- Game rules
- How the code is organized
- Key classes and their responsibilities
"""

    """Core game logic.

    This class manages game state and rules, independent of UI.
    """

    def __init__(self, num_players: int = 2):
        """Initialize game.

        Args:
            num_players: Number of players (2-4)
        """
        self.players = [Player(f"Player {i+1}") for i in range(num_players)]
        self.phase = GamePhase.SETUP
        self.current_player = 0

        Returns:
            bool: True if move was valid
        """
        if not self.is_valid_move(move):
            return False

        return True

    def is_valid_move(self, move) -> bool:
        """Check if move is legal."""
        # Implement validation
        return True

    def is_game_over(self) -> bool:
        """Check if game has ended."""
        # Implement end condition
        return False

    def get_winner(self) -> Optional[Player]:
        """Get game winner, if any."""
        # Implement winner determination
        return None

    def next_player(self):
        """Advance to next player."""
        self.current_player = (self.current_player + 1) % len(self.players)

# CLI interface
def main():
    """Command-line interface."""
    import argparse

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Game Name')
    parser.add_argument('--players', type=int, default=2,
                       help='Number of players')

    # Show results
    winner = game.get_winner()
    print(f"Winner: {winner.name if winner else 'Draw'}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### **main**.py Template

```python
"""Entry point for game_name module."""

from .game_name import main

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Adding AI Opponents

If your game includes AI:

1. **Separate AI Logic**: Keep AI in separate class/module
1. **Difficulty Levels**: Provide at least 2-3 difficulty levels
1. **Explain Strategy**: Document how AI makes decisions
1. **Reasonable Speed**: AI should respond in \<1 second typically

Example AI structure:

```python
class AIPlayer:
    """AI opponent for game.

    Uses [algorithm name] to make decisions.
    """

    def __init__(self, difficulty: str = 'medium'):
        self.difficulty = difficulty

    def choose_move(self, game_state):
        """Choose best move.

        Args:
            game_state: Current game state

        Returns:
            Best move according to AI strategy
        """
        if self.difficulty == 'easy':
            return self.random_move(game_state)
        elif self.difficulty == 'medium':
            return self.heuristic_move(game_state)
        else:  # hard
            return self.optimal_move(game_state)
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Principles

- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- **Documentation**: Explain _why_, not just _what_

### Python Style

Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with these specifics:

```python
# Naming conventions
class MyGameEngine:         # PascalCase for classes
    pass

def calculate_score():      # snake_case for functions
    pass

CONSTANT_VALUE = 42         # UPPER_CASE for constants

my_variable = 10            # snake_case for variables

# Line length: 88 characters (Black formatter default)

# Imports: standard library, third-party, local
import json
import random
from typing import List

import tkinter as tk

from .cards import Deck
from ..common.utils import format_output

# Type hints encouraged
def deal_cards(num_cards: int) -> List[Card]:
    """Deal cards from deck."""
    pass

# Docstrings: Google style
def my_function(param1: int, param2: str) -> bool:
    """Short description.

    Longer description if needed.

    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2

    Returns:
        Description of return value

    Raises:
        ValueError: When params are invalid
    """
    pass
```

### Documentation Style

All modules, classes, and public functions must have docstrings:

```python
"""Module docstring.

Comprehensive explanation of the module, including:
- Purpose and overview
- Key components
- Usage examples
- References to related modules
"""

class GameEngine:
    """Brief description.

    Detailed description of the class, its purpose,
    and how it fits into the larger system.

    Attributes:
        players: List of players in the game
        current_player: Index of active player
    """

    def __init__(self, num_players: int):
        """Initialize game engine.

        Args:
            num_players: Number of players (2-4)

        Raises:
            ValueError: If num_players is out of range
        """
        pass
```

### Test Structure

```python
import unittest
from game_package.game_name import GameEngine, Player

class TestGameEngine(unittest.TestCase):
    """Tests for GameEngine class."""

    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test fixtures."""
        self.game = GameEngine(num_players=2)

    def test_initialization(self):
        """Test game initializes correctly."""
        self.assertEqual(len(self.game.players), 2)
        self.assertEqual(self.game.current_player, 0)

    def test_valid_move(self):
        """Test valid move is accepted."""
        self.game.start()
        result = self.game.make_move(valid_move)
        self.assertTrue(result)

    def test_invalid_move(self):
        """Test invalid move is rejected."""
        self.game.start()
        result = self.game.make_move(invalid_move)
        self.assertFalse(result)

    def test_game_end(self):
        """Test game ends correctly."""
        # Set up winning condition
        self.assertTrue(self.game.is_game_over())
        self.assertIsNotNone(self.game.get_winner())

    def test_edge_cases(self):
        """Test edge cases."""
        # Test boundary conditions
