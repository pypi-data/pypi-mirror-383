## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Compliance

All games follow the repository's established architecture patterns:

- **GameEngine Interface**: All games extend `common.game_engine.GameEngine`
- **Type Hints**: Complete type annotations throughout
- **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings for all public methods
- **Abstract Methods**: All required abstract methods implemented:
  - `reset()`
  - `is_game_over()`
  - `get_current_player()`
  - `get_valid_moves()`
  - `make_move()`
  - `get_winner()`
  - `get_game_state()`

### Code Quality

- **Formatting**: All code formatted with Black (160 character line length)
- **Linting**: Passes Ruff linting checks (no errors)
- **Complexity**: Functions kept under complexity threshold
- **Import Organization**: Clean import statements, unused imports removed

### Testing

Comprehensive test suite added in `tests/`:

- `test_dice_games.py` - 9 tests for dice games
- `test_word_games.py` - 14 tests for word games
- `test_logic_games.py` - 16 tests for logic games

**Total**: 39 tests, all passing

### File Structure

Each game follows the standard structure:

```
game_name/
├── __init__.py          # Package initialization and exports
├── __main__.py          # Entry point for running game
├── game_name.py         # Core game engine logic
├── cli.py               # Command-line interface
└── README.md            # Game-specific documentation
```

## Usage Examples

### Running Games

All games can be run using Python's module syntax:

```bash
# Dice games
python -m dice_games.farkle
python -m dice_games.craps
python -m dice_games.liars_dice
python -m dice_games.bunco

# Word games
python -m word_games.trivia
python -m word_games.crossword

```

### Importing Games

Games can be imported and used programmatically:

```python
from dice_games import FarkleGame
from word_games import TriviaGame
from logic_games import MinesweeperGame

# Create game instances
farkle = FarkleGame(num_players=2)
trivia = TriviaGame(num_questions=5)
minesweeper = MinesweeperGame()

# Use game methods
farkle.reset()
farkle.make_move(([], True))  # Roll dice
```
