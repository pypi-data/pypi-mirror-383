"""
henosis_cli_tools
-----------------
Reusable, policy-aware local machine tools extracted from the server.

Exports:
- FileToolPolicy: sandbox/scope configuration
- resolve_path: path resolution and sandbox enforcement
- read_text_auto: BOM/encoding-aware text reader
- read_file, write_file, append_file, list_dir
- run_command: safe command execution with allowlist and timeout
- apply_patch: simplified multi-file patch applier

These functions are framework-agnostic and can be used by both the
FastAPI server and the standalone CLI.

Also exports:
- SettingsUI: dependency-free interactive settings UI used by henosis-cli.
