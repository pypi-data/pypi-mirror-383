From Implicit to Explicit definition of container constraints (#1333)

# Description

Up until this PR we had implicit configuration of `requires` and
`uniqueness` container constraint, where especially the first constraint
type (set via `Containers` sheet) did not allow for custom user defined
ids. In this PR we enable explicit definition of containers, where from
now onwards stating type of constraint is required. Backward
compatibility with implicit definition of constraints is still possible.

## Bump
