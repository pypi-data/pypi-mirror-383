  abstract =      {We present the details of a method for conducting a
                   targeted, coherent search for compact binary
                   coalescences. The search is tailored to be used as a
                   followup to electromagnetic transients such as Gamma
                   Ray Bursts. We derive the coherent search statistic
                   for Gaussian detector noise and discuss the benefits
                   of a coherent, multi-detector search over coincidence
                   methods. To mitigate the effects of non-stationary
                   data, we introduce a number of signal consistency
                   tests, including the null SNR, amplitude consistency
                   and several $\chi^{2}$ tests. We demonstrate the
                   search performance on Gaussian noise and on data from
                   LIGO's fourth science run and verify that the signal
                   consistency tests are capable of removing the
                   majority of noise transients and the search gives an
                   efficiency comparable to that achieved in Gaussian
                   noise.},

 abstract = {  Precessing black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries produce a rich gravitational wave signal, encoding the binary's nature and inspiral kinematics. Using the lalinference\_mcmc Markov-chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation code, we use two fiducial examples to illustrate how the geometry and kinematics are encoded into the modulated gravitational wave signal, using coordinates well-adapted to precession. Even for precessing binaries, we show the performance of detailed parameter estimation can be estimated by "effective" estimates: comparisons of a prototype signal with its nearest neighbors, adopting a fixed sky location and idealized two-detector network. We use detailed and effective approaches to show higher harmonics provide nonzero but small local improvement when estimating the parameters of precessing BH-NS binaries. That said, we show higher harmonics can improve parameter estimation accuracy for precessing binaries ruling out approximately-degenerate source orientations. <br />Our work illustrates quantities gravitational wave measurements can provide, such as reliable component masses and the precise orientation of a precessing short gamma ray burst progenitor relative to the line of sight. "Effective" estimates may provide a simple way to estimate trends in the performance of parameter estimation for generic precessing BH-NS binaries in next-generation detectors. For example, our results suggest that the orbital chirp rate, precession rate, and precession geometry are roughly-independent observables, defining natural variables to organize correlations in the high-dimensional BH-NS binary parameter space.},

  abstract =      {The most promising source of gravitational waves for
                   the planned kilometer-size laser-interferometer
                   detectors LIGO and VIRGO are merging compact
                   binaries, i.e., neutron-star-neutron-star (NS-NS),
                   neutron-star-black-hole (NS-BH), and
                   black-hole-black-hole (BH-BH) binaries. We
                   investigate how accurately the distance to the source
                   and the masses and spins of the two bodies will be
                   measured from the inspiral gravitational wave signals
                   by the three-detector LIGO-VIRGO network using
                   ``advanced detectors'' (those present a few years
                   after initial operation). The large number of cycles
                   in the observable waveform increases our sensitivity
                   to those parameters that affect the inspiral rate,
                   and thereby the evolution of the waveform's phase.
                   These parameters are thus measured much more
                   accurately than parameters which affect the
                   waveform's polarization or amplitude. To lowest order
                   in a post-Newtonian expansion, the evolution of the
                   waveform's phase depends only on the combination
                   scrM=(M1M2)3/5(M1+M2)-1/5 of the masses M1 and M2 of
                   the two bodies, which is known as the ``chirp mass.''
                   To post-1-Newtonian order, the waveform's phase also
                   depends sensitively on the binary's reduced mass
                   mu=M1M2/(M1+M2) allowing, in principle, a measurement
                   of both M1 and M2 with high accuracy. We show that
                   the principal obstruction to measuring M1 and M2 is
                   the post-1.5-Newtonian effect of the bodies' spins on
                   the waveform's phase, which can mimic the effects
                   that allow mu to be determined. The chirp mass is
                   measurable with an accuracy
                   DeltascrM/scrM~=0.1\%-1\%. Although this is a
                   remarkably small error bar, it is ~10 times larger
                   than previous estimates of DeltascrM/scrM which
                   neglected post-Newtonian effects. The reduced mass is
                   measurable to ~10\%-15\% for NS-NS and NS-BH
                   binaries, and ~50\% for BH-BH binaries (assuming
                   10Msolar BH's). Measurements of the masses and spins
                   are strongly correlated; there is a combination of mu
                   and the spin angular momenta that is measured to
                   within ~1\%. Moreover, if both spins were somehow
                   known to be small (<~0.01M21 and <~0.01M22,
                   respectively), then mu could be determined to within
                   ~1\%. Finally, building on earlier work of Markovic,
                   we derive an approximate, analytic expression for the
                   accuracy DeltaD of mesurements of the distance D to
                   the binary, for an arbitrary network of detectors.
                   This expression is accurate to linear order in 1/rho,
                   where rho is the signal-to-noise ratio. We also show
                   that, contrary to previous expectations,
                   contributions to DeltaD/D that are nonlinear in 1/rho
                   are significant, and we develop an approximation
                   scheme for including the dominant of these nonlinear
                   effects. Using a Monte Carlo simulation we estimate
                   that distance measurement accuracies will be <=15\%
                   for ~8\% of the detected signals, and <=30\% for
                   ~60\% of the signals, for the LIGO-VIRGO
                   three-detector network.},

                   emitted by precessing binaries of spinning compact
                   objects is complicated by the large number of
                   parameters (such as the magnitudes and initial
                   directions of the spins, and the position and
                   orientation of the binary with respect to the
                   detector) that are required to model accurately the
                   precession-induced modulations of the GW signal. In
                   this paper we describe a fast matched-filtering
                   search scheme for precessing binaries, and we adopt
                   the physical template family proposed by Buonanno,
                   Chen, and Vallisneri [Phys.Rev.D 67, 104025 (2003)]
                   for ground-based interferometers. This family
                   provides essentially exact waveforms, written
                   directly in terms of the physical parameters, for
                   binaries with a single significant spin, and for
                   which the observed GW signal is emitted during the
                   phase of adiabatic inspiral (for LIGO-I and VIRGO,
                   this corresponds to a total mass M &lt; 15Msun). We
                   show how the detection statistic can be maximized
                   automatically over all the parameters (including the
                   position and orientation of the binary with respect
                   to the detector), except four (the two masses, the
                   magnitude of the single spin, and the opening angle
                   between the spin and the orbital angular momentum),
                   so the template bank used in the search is only
                   four-dimensional; this technique is relevant also to
                   the searches for GW from extreme--mass-ratio
                   inspirals and supermassive blackhole inspirals to be
                   performed using the space-borne detector LISA. Using
                   the LIGO-I design sensitivity, we compute the

                   ringdown) of coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) for
                   initial and advanced ground-based interferometers
                   (LIGO-VIRGO) and for the space-based interferometer
                   LISA. Ground-based interferometers can do moderate
                   SNR (a few tens), moderate accuracy studies of BBH
                   coalescences in the mass range of a few to about 2000
                   solar masses; LISA can do high SNR (of order 104),
                   high accuracy studies in the mass range of about
                   105-108 solar masses. BBHs might well be the first
                   sources detected by LIGO-VIRGO: they are visible to
                   much larger distances-up to 500 Mpc by initial
                   interferometers-than coalescing neutron star binaries
                   (heretofore regarded as the ``bread and butter''
                   workhorse source for LIGO-VIRGO, visible to about 30
                   Mpc by initial interferometers). Low-mass BBHs (up to
                   50Msolar for initial LIGO interferometers, 100Msolar
                   for advanced, 106Msolar for LISA) are best searched
                   for via their well-understood inspiral waves; higher
                   mass BBHs must be searched for via their poorly
                   understood merger waves and/or their well-understood
                   ringdown waves. A matched filtering search for
                   massive BBHs based on ringdown waves should be
                   capable of finding BBHs in the mass range of about
                   100Msolar-700Msolar out to ~200 Mpc for initial LIGO
                   interferometers, and in the mass range of ~200Msolar
                   to ~3000Msolar out to about z=1 for advanced
                   interferometers. The required number of templates is
                   of the order of 6000 or less. Searches based on
                   merger waves could increase the number of detected
                   massive BBHs by a factor of the order of 10 over
                   those found from inspiral and ringdown waves, without
                   detailed knowledge of the waveform shapes, using a
                   noise monitoring search algorithm which we describe.
                   A full set of merger templates from numerical
                   relativity simulations could further increase the
                   number of detected BBHs by an additional factor of up
                   to ~4.},

                   analysis of the gravitational-wave signals from
                   spinning neutron stars for Earth-based laser
                   interferometric detectors. We introduce a detailed
                   model of the signal including both the frequency and
                   the amplitude modulations. We include the effects of
                   the intrinsic frequency changes and the modulation of
                   the frequency at the detector due to Earth's motion.
                   We estimate the effects of the star's proper motion
                   and of relativistic corrections. Moreover we consider
                   a signal consisting of two components corresponding
                   to a frequency f and twice that frequency. From the
                   maximum likelihood principle we derive the detection
                   statistics for the signal and we calculate the
                   probability density function of the statistics. We
                   obtain the data analysis procedure to detect the
                   signal and to estimate its parameters. We show that
                   for optimal detection of the amplitude modulated
                   signal we need four linear filters instead of one
                   linear filter needed for a constant amplitude signal.
                   Searching for the doubled frequency signal increases
                   further the number of linear filters by a factor of
                   2. We indicate how the fast Fourier transform
                   algorithm and resampling methods commonly proposed in
                   the analysis of periodic signals can be used to
                   calculate the detection statistics for our signal. We
                   find that the probability density function of the
                   detection statistics is determined by one parameter:
                   the optimal signal-to-noise ratio. We study the
                   signal-to-noise ratio by means of the Monte Carlo
                   method for all long-arm interferometers that are
                   currently under construction. We show how our
                   analysis can be extended to perform a joint search
                   for periodic signals by a network of detectors and we
                   perform a Monte Carlo study of the signal-to-noise
                   ratio for a network of detectors.},

                   waveforms for spinning compact binaries with
                   precession effects through 1.5PN order in amplitude
                   and compute their mode decomposition using
                   spin-weighted -2 spherical harmonics. In the presence
                   of precession, the gravitational-wave modes (l,m)
                   contain harmonics originating from combinations of
                   the orbital frequency and precession frequencies. We
                   find that the gravitational radiation from binary
                   systems with large mass asymmetry and large
                   inclination angle can be distributed among several
                   modes. For example, during the last stages of
                   inspiral, for some maximally spinning configurations,
                   the amplitude of the (2,0) and (2,1) modes can be
                   comparable to the amplitude of the (2,2) mode. If the
                   mass ratio is not too extreme, the l=3 and l=4 modes
                   are generally one or two orders of magnitude smaller
                   than the l = 2 modes. Restricting ourselves to
                   spinning, non-precessing compact binaries, we apply
                   the stationary-phase approximation and derive the
                   frequency-domain gravitational waveforms including
                   spin-orbit and spin(1)- spin(2) effects through 1.5PN
                   and 2PN order respectively in amplitude, and 2.5PN
                   order in phase. Since spin effects in the amplitude
                   through 2PN order affect only the first and second
                   harmonics of the orbital phase, they do not extend
                   the mass reach of gravitational-wave detectors.
                   However, they can interfere with other harmonics and
                   lower or raise the signal-to-noise ratio depending on
                   the spin orientation. These ready-to-use waveforms
                   could be employed in the data-analysis of the
                   spinning, inspiraling binaries as well as in
                   comparison studies at the interface between
                   analytical and numerical relativity.},

                   solved perturbatively using the post-Newtonian (PN)
                   approximation. The evolution of the orbital phase and
                   the emitted gravitational radiation are now known to
                   a rather high order up to O(v^8), v being the
                   characteristic velocity of the binary. The orbital
                   evolution, however, cannot be specified uniquely due
                   to the inherent freedom in the choice of parameter
                   used in the PN expansion as well as the method
                   pursued in solving the relevant differential
                   equations. The goal of this paper is to determine the
                   (dis)agreement between different PN waveform families
                   in the context of initial and advanced
                   gravitational-wave detectors. The waveforms employed
                   in our analysis are those that are currently used by
                   Initial LIGO/Virgo, that is the time-domain PN models
                   TaylorT1, TaylorT2, TaylorT3, TaylorT4 and TaylorEt,
                   the effective one-body (EOB) model, and the
                   Fourier-domain representation TaylorF2. We examine
                   the overlaps of these models with one another and
                   with the prototype effective one-body model
                   (calibrated to numerical relativity simulations, as
                   currently used by initial LIGO) for a number of
                   different binaries at 2PN, 3PN and 3.5PN orders to
                   quantify their differences and to help us decide
                   whether there exist preferred families that are the
                   most appropriate as search templates. We conclude
                   that as long as the total mass remains less than a
                   certain upper limit M_crit, all template families at
                   3.5PN order (except TaylorT3 and TaylorEt) are
                   equally good for the purpose of detection. The value
                   of M_crit is found to be ~ 12M_Sun for Initial,
                   Enhanced and Advanced LIGO. From a purely
                   computational point of view we recommend that 3.5PN
                   TaylorF2 be used below Mcrit and EOB calibrated to
                   numerical relativity simulations be used for total
                   binary mass M > Mcrit.},

  abstract={We present the first attempt at calibrating the effective-one-body (EOB) model to accurate numerical-relativity simulations of spinning, non-precessing black-hole binaries. Aligning the EOB and numerical waveforms at low frequency over a time interval of 1000M, we first estimate the phase and amplitude errors in the numerical waveforms and then minimize the difference between numerical and EOB waveforms by calibrating a handful of EOB-adjustable parameters. In the equal-mass, spin aligned case, we find that phase and fractional amplitude differences between the numerical and EOB (2,2) mode can be reduced to 0.01 radians and 1%, respectively, over the entire inspiral waveforms. In the equal-mass, spin anti-aligned case, these differences can be reduced to 0.13 radians and 1% during inspiral and plunge, and to 0.4 radians and 10% during merger and ringdown. The waveform agreement is within numerical errors in the spin aligned case while slightly over numerical errors in the spin anti-aligned case. Using Enhanced LIGO and Advanced LIGO noise curves, we find that the overlap between the EOB and the numerical (2,2) mode, maximized over the initial phase and time of arrival, is larger than 0.999 for binaries with total mass 30-200Ms. In addition to the leading (2,2) mode, we compare four subleading modes. We find good amplitude and frequency agreements between the EOB and numerical modes for both spin configurations considered, except for the (3,2) mode in the spin anti-aligned case. We believe that the larger difference in the (3,2) mode is due to the lack of knowledge of post-Newtonian spin effects in the higher modes.}

 abstract = {  Compact binary systems with neutron stars or black holes are one of the most promising sources for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Gravitational radiation encodes rich information about source physics; thus parameter estimation and model selection are crucial analysis steps for any detection candidate events. Detailed models of the anticipated waveforms enable inference on several parameters, such as component masses, spins, sky location and distance that are essential for new astrophysical studies of these sources. However, accurate measurements of these parameters and discrimination of models describing the underlying physics are complicated by artifacts in the data, uncertainties in the waveform models and in the calibration of the detectors. Here we report such measurements on a selection of simulated signals added either in hardware or software to the data collected by the two LIGO instruments and the Virgo detector during their most recent joint science run, including a "blind injection" where the signal was not initially revealed to the collaboration. We exemplify the ability to extract information about the source physics on signals that cover the neutron star and black hole parameter space over the individual mass range 1 Msun - 25 Msun and the full range of spin parameters. The cases reported in this study provide a snap-shot of the status of parameter estimation in preparation for the operation of advanced detectors.},

The detector, built at Cascina, near Pisa (Italy), is a very large Michelson interferometer, with 3 km-long arms. In this paper, following a presentation of the physics requirements, leading to the specifications for the construction of the detector, a detailed description of all its different elements is given. These include civil engineering infrastructures, a huge ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber (about 6000 cubic metres), all of the optical components, including high quality mirrors and their seismic isolating suspensions, all of the electronics required to control the interferometer and for signal detection. The expected performances of these different elements are given, leading to an overall sensitivity curve as a function of the incoming gravitational wave frequency. This description represents the detector as built and used in the first data-taking runs. Improvements in different parts have been and continue to be performed, leading to better sensitivities. These will be detailed in a forthcoming paper.}

 abstract = {  One of the main bottlenecks in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy is the high cost of performing parameter estimation and GW searches on the fly. We propose a novel technique based on Reduced Order Quadratures (ROQs), an application and data-specific quadrature rule, to perform fast and accurate likelihood evaluations. These are the dominant cost in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, which are widely employed in parameter estimation studies, and so ROQs offer a new way to accelerate GW parameter estimation. We illustrate our approach using a four dimensional GW burst model embedded in noise. We build an ROQ for this model, and perform four dimensional MCMC searches with both the standard and ROQs quadrature rules, showing that, for this model, the ROQ approach is around 25 times faster than the standard approach with essentially no loss of accuracy. The speed-up from using ROQs is expected to increase for more complex GW signal models and therefore has significant potential to accelerate parameter estimation of GW sources such as compact binary coalescences.},

 abstract = {  Current searches for gravitational waves from compact binaries use templates where the binary does not precess. By contrast, generic black hole-neutron star binaries will significantly precess, inducing modulations that nonprecessing searches are particularly ill-suited to recover. In this paper we provide a closed-form representation of the single-spin precessing waveform in the frequency domain by reorganizing the signal as a sum over harmonics, each of which resembles a nonprecessing waveform. This form enables simple analytic calculations (e.g., a Fisher matrix) and computationally fast frequency-domain templates. We have verified that our \texttt{SpinTaylorF2SingleSpin} model is faithful to the time-domain \texttt{SpinTaylorT2} model: for the majority of generic BH-NS binaries, the corresponding signals generated from each model agree to better than 1%. Our waveform model is now available as part of the publicly-available \texttt{lalsimulation} waveform-generation code.}

  abstract={The increasing sophistication and accuracy of numerical simulations of compact binaries (especially binary black holes) presents the opportunity to test the regime in which post-Newtonian (PN) predictions for the emitted gravitational waves are accurate. In order to confront numerical results with those of post-Newtonian theory, it is convenient to compare multipolar decompositions of the two waveforms. It is pointed out here that the individual modes can be computed to higher post-Newtonian order by examining the radiative multipole moments of the system, rather than by decomposing the 2.5PN polarization waveforms. In particular, the dominant (l=2, m=±2) mode can be computed to 3PN order. Individual modes are computed to as high a post-Newtonian order as possible given previous post-Newtonian results.}

 abstract = {  Searches for gravitational waves with km-scale laser interferometers often involve the long-wavelength approximation to describe the detector response. The prevailing assumption is that the corrections to the detector response due to its finite size are small and the errors due to the long-wavelength approximation are negligible. Recently, however, Baskaran and Grishchuk (2004 Class. Quantum Grav. 21 4041) found that in a simple Michelson interferometer such errors can be as large as 10 percent. For more accurate analysis, these authors proposed to use a linear-frequency correction to the long wavelength approximation. In this paper we revisit these calculations. We show that the linear-frequency correction is inadequate for certain locations in the sky and therefore accurate analysis requires taking into account the exact formula, commonly derived from the photon round-trip propagation time. Also, we extend the calculations to include the effect of Fabry-Perot resonators in the interferometer arms. Here we show that a simple approximation which combines the long-wavelength Michelson response with the single-pole approximation to the Fabry-Perot transfer function produces rather accurate results. In particular, the difference between the exact and the approximate formulae is at most 2-3 percent for those locations in the sky where the detector response is greater than half of its maximum value. We analyse the impact of such errors on detection sensitivity and parameter estimation in searches for periodic gravitational waves emitted by a known pulsar, and in searches for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background. At frequencies up to 1 kHz, the effect of such errors is at most 1-2 percent. For higher frequencies, or if more accuracy is required, one should use the exact formula for the response.},

 abstract = {  Computation of the marginal likelihood from a simulated posterior distribution is central to Bayesian model selection but is computationally difficult. I argue that the marginal likelihood can be reliably computed from a posterior sample by careful attention to the numerics of the probability integral. Posing the expression for the marginal likelihood as a Lebesgue integral, we may convert the harmonic mean approximation from a sample statistic to a quadrature rule. As a quadrature, the harmonic mean approximation suffers from enormous truncation error as consequence . In addition, I demonstrate that the integral expression for the harmonic-mean approximation converges slowly at best for high-dimensional problems with uninformative prior distributions. These observations lead to two computationally-modest families of quadrature algorithms that use the full generality sample posterior but without the instability. The first algorithm automatically eliminates the part of the sample that contributes large truncation error. The second algorithm uses the posterior sample to assign probability to a partition of the sample space and performs the marginal likelihood integral directly. This eliminates convergence issues. The first algorithm is analogous to standard quadrature but can only be applied for convergent problems. The second is a hybrid of cubature: it uses the posterior to discover and tessellate the subset of that sample space was explored and uses quantiles to compute a representive field value. Neither algorithm makes strong assumptions about the shape of the posterior distribution and neither is sensitive outliers. [abridged]},
