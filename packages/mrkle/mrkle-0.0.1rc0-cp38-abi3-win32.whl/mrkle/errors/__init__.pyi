class MerkleError(BaseException):
    """
    Base Exception for all Merkle tree related errors.

    This serves as the root Error type for the mrkle library,
    allowing users to catch all library-specific Errors with a single handler.

    # Example
    ```python
    try:
        pass
    except mrkle.MerkleError as e:
        print(f"Merkle operation failed: {e}")

class ProofError(MerkleError):
    """
    Exception raised when Merkle proof operations fail.

    # Example
    ```python
    try:
         pass
    except mrkle.ProofError as e:
        print(f"Proof verification failed: {e}")

class SerdeError(MerkleError):
    """
    Exception raised when serialization/deserialization operations fail.
