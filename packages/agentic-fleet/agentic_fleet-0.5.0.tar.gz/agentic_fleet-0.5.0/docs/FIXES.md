# AgenticFleet Bug Fixes - October 10, 2025

This document tracks all bug fixes applied to the AgenticFleet codebase to resolve deployment issues and align with Microsoft Agent Framework best practices.

---

## Summary of Fixes

### Phase 1: Initial Deployment Fixes
1. Fixed TOML syntax error in `pyproject.toml`
2. Fixed OpenAI client initialization parameters across all agents and workflow
3. Updated to use `OpenAIResponsesClient` instead of `OpenAIChatClient`

### Phase 2: UV Package Manager Configuration
4. Fixed `pyproject.toml` to use correct `uv` syntax for dependency groups

---

## Detailed Fix Documentation

### 1. TOML Parse Error - Fixed ✓

**Issue:**
```
TOML parse error at line 37: unknown field `dependencies-groups`, expected ... `dependency-groups`
```

**Root Cause:**
Typo in `pyproject.toml` - used incorrect field name for uv's dependency groups.

**Fix:**
Changed `dependencies-groups.dev` to `dependency-groups.dev` in the `[tool.uv]` section.

**Files Modified:**
- `pyproject.toml` (line 37)

---

### 2. OpenAI Client Migration - Fixed ✓

**Issue:**
Application was using `OpenAIChatClient` which is for chat completions, but should use `OpenAIResponsesClient` for OpenAI Responses API.

**Root Cause:**
Microsoft Agent Framework provides two client types:
- `OpenAIChatClient`: For basic chat completions
- `OpenAIResponsesClient`: For OpenAI Responses API with structured outputs

**Migration Steps:**
1. Changed imports from `OpenAIChatClient` to `OpenAIResponsesClient`
2. Updated all client initialization to use `model_id` parameter
3. Removed temperature and api_key parameters (handled by environment)

**Before:**
```python
from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient

client = OpenAIChatClient(
    model_id=agent_config.get("model", settings.openai_model),
)
```

**After:**
```python
from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIResponsesClient

client = OpenAIResponsesClient(
    model_id=agent_config.get("model", settings.openai_model),
)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `agents/orchestrator_agent/agent.py`
- `agents/researcher_agent/agent.py`
- `agents/coder_agent/agent.py`
- `agents/analyst_agent/agent.py`
- `workflows/magentic_workflow.py`

---

### 3. UV Dependency Groups Syntax - Fixed ✓

**Issue:**
```
warning: The `tool.uv.dev-dependencies` field is deprecated
```

**Root Cause:**
UV package manager changed syntax for dependency groups in recent versions.

**Fix:**
Updated `pyproject.toml` to use the correct syntax:

**Before:**
```toml
[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [...]
```

**After:**
```toml
[tool.uv.sources]

[dependency-groups]
dev = [...]
```

**Files Modified:**
- `pyproject.toml`

---

## Verification Results

### Configuration Tests
```bash
uv run python test_config.py
```
**Result:** ✓ All 6/6 tests passed

### Application Startup
```bash
echo "quit" | uv run python main.py
```
**Result:** ✓ Application starts successfully with all agents initialized

**Output:**
```
✅ Workflow created successfully!
   🤖 Agents: Orchestrator, Researcher, Coder, Analyst
   🛠️  Tools: Web search, Code interpreter, Data analysis
```

---

## Key Learnings

### OpenAI Responses API
- Use `OpenAIResponsesClient` for structured responses and agent applications
- Use `OpenAIChatClient` for basic chat completions only
- Both clients accept `model_id` parameter
- API key must be in `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- Temperature and other parameters are controlled at the agent or model call level

### UV Package Manager
- Always use `uv run` to execute Python commands
- Use `[dependency-groups]` for optional dependency groups
- Place after `[tool.uv.sources]` section in `pyproject.toml`

### Notes

1. **Temperature Configuration**: While the agent configurations still define temperature values, these are currently not being passed to `OpenAIChatClient`. The framework may support temperature through other mechanisms (e.g., model call parameters, ChatAgent settings, or conversation context).

2. **Workflow Cycle Warning**: The framework detects a cycle in the agent graph:

   ```
   agent_analyst -> agent_coder -> agent_researcher -> agent_orchestrator -> 
   magentic_orchestrator -> agent_analyst
   ```

   This is expected for multi-agent coordination and is handled by the framework's termination limits (`max_rounds`, `max_stalls`, `max_resets`).

3. **API Key**: The system now relies on the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable being set, which is the standard pattern for the Microsoft Agent Framework.
