Toolkit of common functions used across GrimoireLab projects.

This package provides a library composed by functions widely used in other
GrimoireLab projects. These function deal with date handling, introspection,
URIs/URLs, among other topics.

## Requirements

 * Python >= 3.8

You will also need some other libraries for running the tool, you can find the
whole list of dependencies in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file.

## Installation

There are several ways to install GrimoireLab Toolkit on your system: packages or source 
code using Poetry or pip.

### PyPI

GrimoireLab Toolkit can be installed using pip, a tool for installing Python packages. 
To do it, run the next command:
```

packaging. You can install it following its [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
Once you have installed it, you can install GrimoireLab Toolkit and the dependencies in 
a project isolated environment using:
