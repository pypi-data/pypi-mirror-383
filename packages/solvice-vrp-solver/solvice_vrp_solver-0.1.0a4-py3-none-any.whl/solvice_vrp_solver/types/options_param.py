    """
    Clustering threshold in meters defining the buffer zone around each route's
    bounding box. Routes whose expanded bounding boxes (including buffer) overlap
    will be penalized based on their actual overlap area. This threshold acts as a
    proximity trigger - routes should ideally stay at least this distance apart.
    Default: 10000 meters (10km).

    enable_clustering: Annotated[bool, PropertyInfo(alias="enableClustering")]
    """Enable geographic clustering constraint to discourage route overlap.

    When enabled, routes are penalized if their bounding boxes overlap, encouraging
    visually distinct geographic territories for each route. This is a soft
    constraint that promotes clearer route separation without strictly enforcing
    non-overlapping regions. Default: false.
    """

    euclidian: Optional[bool]
    """
    Use euclidean distance calculations for travel time and distance instead of real
    road networks. When true, straight-line distances are used which is faster but
    less accurate. When false (default), routing engines like OSM, TomTom, or Google
    provide real road distances and travel times.

    When true, the solver attempts to distribute service time evenly across all

    """
    Maximum number of alternative assignment suggestions to return when using the
    suggestion endpoint. The solver generates multiple assignment options for
    unassigned jobs, ranked by quality. A value of 0 (default) returns all possible
    suggestions, while values 1-5 limit the results to the best alternatives. Higher
    values increase response time but provide more options.

    When true, the solver prioritizes using fewer resources (vehicles/drivers) even
    if it increases total travel time. When false, the solver prioritizes minimizing
    total travel time even if it requires more resources. This fundamentally changes
    the optimization strategy.

    only_feasible_suggestions: Annotated[Optional[bool], PropertyInfo(alias="onlyFeasibleSuggestions")]
    """Filter suggestions based on feasibility.

    When true (default), only suggestions that don't violate hard constraints are
    returned if the initial plan is feasible. If the initial plan is infeasible,
    only suggestions that don't worsen the infeasibility are returned. When false,
    all suggestions are returned regardless of feasibility, which may include
    constraint violations.

    partial_planning: Annotated[Optional[bool], PropertyInfo(alias="partialPlanning")]
    """
    Allow the solver to create solutions where not all jobs are assigned to
    resources. When true (default), the solver will assign as many jobs as possible

    Generate detailed route polylines (encoded route geometries) for each trip

    All calculated arrival times are rounded up to the nearest multiple of this
    value. For example, with snapUnit=300 (5 minutes), an arrival time of 08:32

    score calculation during optimization.
