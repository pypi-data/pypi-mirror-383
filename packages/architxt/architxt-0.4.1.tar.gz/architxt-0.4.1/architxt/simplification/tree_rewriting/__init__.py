    - In TreeBucket mode, tree IDs are consumed from a shared queue.
      A sentinel value (None) signals the end of the input.
      Each worker processes trees incrementally and commits changes in batches.
    - In list-based mode (plain Forest), the entire collection is processed in a single pass.

    Workers synchronize using a barrier after each operation.

    MLflow's tracing buffers spans in memory and exports the entire trace only when the root span concludes.
    This design does not inherently support multiprocessing, as spans created in separate processes are isolated
    and cannot be automatically aggregated into a single trace.
    As a result, we need to manually export spans from each subprocess and send them to the main process.
    To achieve this, an independent trace is created for each worker, which is then merged with the main trace.
    This means we SHOULD NOT pass OpenTelemetry context to the subprocess.
    Only the request id is sent, and we let the main process retrieve the trace from the tracking store
