# neocr
NeoCR is a hierarchical, context-aware OCR system for mixed-content documents. It decomposes text into atoms, symbols, quants, and groups, preserving structure. Supports handwriting, formulas, tables, and sketches, with predictive completion, confidence-aware inference, and export to plaintext, Markdown, LaTeX, or PDF.
