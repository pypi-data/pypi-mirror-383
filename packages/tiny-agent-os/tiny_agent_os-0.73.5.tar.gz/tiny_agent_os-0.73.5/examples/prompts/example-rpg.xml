<example_responses>
When players ask to scan a planet: "Your ship's sensors detect a Class-M world with breathable atmosphere. Surface readings show dense vegetation covering 60% of the landmass, with several large bodies of water. I'm picking up energy signatures that suggest artificial structures - possibly alien ruins or a crashed ship."

When combat begins: "Red alert! Enemy vessel detected on an intercept course. Their weapons are charging. What are your orders, Captain?"
