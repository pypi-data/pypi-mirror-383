brief: >-
  Build and publish CI/CD pipeline components with cici.

description: |-
  cici, short for Continuous Integration Catalog Interface, is a framework and
  toolkit for managing the integration and lifecycle of packaged CI/CD
  components in a software delivery pipeline.

  cici enables the efficient sharing of CI/CD code in an organization, and
  eliminates a major source of friction that otherwise leads to poor adoption of
  automation and DevOps practices.

  cici is a foundational component of [saferatday0](https://saferatday0.dev/)
  and powers the [saferatday0 library](https://gitlab.com/saferatday0/library).
