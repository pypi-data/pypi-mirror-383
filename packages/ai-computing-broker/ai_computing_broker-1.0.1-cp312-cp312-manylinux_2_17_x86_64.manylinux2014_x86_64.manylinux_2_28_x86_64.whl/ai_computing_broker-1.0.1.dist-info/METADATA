# Fujitsu AI Computing Broker (ACB)

**Runtime-aware GPU resource management middleware for AI workloads**

## What is ACB?

Fujitsu AI Computing Broker (ACB) is an intelligent middleware that dynamically optimizes GPU allocation and manages memory oversubscription for AI/ML workloads. It monitors your AI framework in real-time to allocate GPUs only when needed, maximizing efficiency and reducing computing costs.

## Key Benefits
- **Improved GPU Utilization**: Automatically reclaims idle GPU time during CPU-bound phases (preprocessing, data loading)
- **Higher Throughput**: Advanced scheduling with backfill optimization enables running more jobs concurrently
- **Zero Code Changes**: Deploy with automatic mode - no modification to existing PyTorch programs required
- **Memory Oversubscription**: Run multiple models on a single GPU when memory allows
- **Cost Reduction**: Get more value from your GPU infrastructure through better resource utilization

## Core Features
- **Runtime-Aware Allocation**: Monitors PyTorch framework to assign GPUs dynamically during compute-intensive phases
- **Full Memory Access**: Active programs get complete GPU memory without virtualization constraints (unlike MIG/vGPU)
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: FIFO, GPU-sharing, and GPU-affinity schedulers with backfill support
- **Multi-GPU & Multi-Node**: Supports distributed training with PyTorch DDP across multiple nodes
- **Fast Deployment**: Works with unmodified programs via automatic interception or manual API integration

## Quick Start
```bash
# Install
pip install ai-computing-broker

# Start GPU Assigner
gpu_assigner start

# Run your existing PyTorch program (no code changes!)
AGA_ENABLE_AUTO=1 agarun python your_training_script.py
