    Task:
    1. Suggest algorithmic fixes or improvements.
    2. Propose new operators or parameters for OpenEvolve.
    3. Design a structured prompt that includes:
       - Evolutionary search guidance
       - Constraints
       - Expected outputs
    4. Make sure that the generated prompt is concise and not too long (<= {max_tokens} tokens).
    
    Output the final optimized prompt as plain text only (no explanation). Do not use Markdown code fences (```), do not include backslash escapes like '\n', '\t', or escaped quotes like '\"'. Output the prompt as normal readable text.
