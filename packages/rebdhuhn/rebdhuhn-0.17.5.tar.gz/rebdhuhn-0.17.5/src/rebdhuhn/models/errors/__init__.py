    """
    Exception raised when a Graph is too complex to convert with Plantuml.

    To understand what this means exactly, we first define the term "last common ancestor" (LCA in the following).
    Let V be an arbitrary node with indegree > 1.
    Define K_arr as the set of all possible paths K_i from the root node ("Start") to V.
    The LCA of V is the node in K_i which is the last common node (orientation is "Start" -> V)
    of all paths in K_arr. I.e. the node where the paths of K_arr split.

    The definition of the LCA is pictured in `src/last_common_ancestor.svg`.

    The graph is too complex for plantuml if there are multiple different nodes V with the same LCA.
    This is also pictured in `src/plantuml_not_convertable.svg`.

    Btw, the reason is the structure of the used Plantuml script language - as of now, maybe they change it in the
    future.
