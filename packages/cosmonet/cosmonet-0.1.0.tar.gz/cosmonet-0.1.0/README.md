CosmoNet is a Python package for astronomical light curve classification using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). It combines traditional statistical features with physics-based features derived from astronomical principles to achieve high-accuracy classification of astronomical transients.

## Features

- **Physics-Informed Features**: Incorporates domain knowledge from astronomy
- **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Combines multiple machine learning models
- **Time Series Analysis**: Specialized features for light curve temporal patterns
- **Redshift Correction**: Accounts for cosmological effects
- **Extreme Event Detection**: Identifies significant flux variations
- **Research-Ready**: Generates publication-quality figures and analysis

## Installation

```bash
pip install cosmonet
